        "text": "A progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DNs), a Parkinson\u2019s disease-like phenotype, was detected in conditional Dicer KO mice in post-mitotic midbrain, which suggested that miRNAs are essential for the terminal differentiation and/or maintenance of multiple neuron types, including midbrain DNs (92, 93). Wang et al. (94) analyzed miRNA expression profiles of human brain tissue from non-demented individuals with negligible clinical features of AD, non-demented individuals with incipient clinical features of AD, individuals with mild cognitive impairment with moderate clinical AD, and individuals with full-blown clinical features of AD. They reported significantly decreased miR-107 levels in patients with even the earliest stages of the disease. They further analyzed the role of this miRNA and concluded that miR-107 may be involved in accelerated disease progression through regulation of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Hebert et al. (95) recently demonstrated that miR-29a, miR-29b-1, and miR-9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro and that these miRNAs were decreased in AD patients resulting with high BACE1 protein. miRNAs have also been implicated in chronic psychiatric disorders. With many targets in common, miR-206 and miR-198 loci were found to be associated with schizophrenia (96). In addition, miR-26b, miR-30b, miR-29b, miR-195, miR-92, miR-24, miR-30e were shown by microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to be decreased in samples from individuals with schizophrenia (97). These miRNAs and their targets and how they may be involved in common complex neurological and psychiatric disease states are yet to be examined.",

        "text": "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in patients with severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. The causative agent was a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1\u20134]. The worrisome features of COVID-19 are its ability to spread readily and its propensity to cause severe disease in older adults and patients with pre-existed health conditions. These cases are often associated with a high risk of cerebrovascular diseases, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and even death [5, 6]. Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular comorbidities are among the most common cause of death associated with COVID-19 [6]. Stroke incidence and cerebrovascular disease have been reported in 5% and 5.7% of COVID-19 pateints, repectively [7]. However, the thrombotic changes are generalized and occur in all regions of the body - not only in the brain), as it was demonstrated by previous studies like thromboses in the lung [8], kidney infractions [9], as well as overt intravascular disseminated coagulation [10]. The pro-inflammatory biomarkers were elevated signicantly due to the COVID-19 infection. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers are known to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in the elderly and chronically ill patients [11]. Although there are no supporting evidences to the role of inflammation in stroke pathogenesis, it was suggested that inflammation might cause a stroke by several mechanisms such as genetic susceptibility, presence of traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and cardiac diseases), and infectious diseases [12]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein synthesized in the liver as an acute-phase reactant in response to an inflammation; and it plays a significant role in the pathophysiological process of stroke [13]. D-dimer is a small protein fragment produced by fibrinolysis\u2019s degradation of the blood clot that might be used to diagnose thrombosis by measuring its concentration [14]. The elevation of circulated D-dimer plasma concentration indicates activation in blood coagulation thrombin formation, particularly in the intra-arterial that is associated with ischemia [15]. Several studies also have reported associations between ischemic cerebrovascular disease and inflammatory indexes such as CRP and fibrinogen [16, 17]. In addition, other studies have reported an increase in stroke severity with elevated D-dimer concentration [18, 19]. The associations between serum levels of CRP and D-dimer and stroke suggest a relation between the inflammatory process and the risk of stroke. Accordingly, this meta-analysis study was performed (i) to investigate overall event rate of pre-exicisting cerbrovavcualr disease in pateints with COVID-19, (ii) to find the association between pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases and disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients; and (iii) to evaluate the risk of severity and mortality associated with high levels of CRP and D-dimer levels in COVID patients.",

The strength of a single miRNA lies predominantly in the fact that it can influence the expression of an array of proteins. Thus, often the inhibitory effect of one miRNA on one protein is only marginal, but it is the cumulative effect of one miRNA on many proteins that results in the final cellular behavioral response. Changes in the expression level of a single miRNA can thus be an important factor in severe pathological conditions. Among the first miRNAs that were suggested to play a direct role in tumor biology were mir-15a and mir-16-1. They were originally found in a genomic area that is often deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and these miRNAs were shown to be lost in about 70% of developing CLL (73). Strikingly, many other miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or fragile areas as well (74). Besides mir-15-1 and mir-16-1, a variety of other miRNAs have now been shown to play a direct role in tumor biology, functioning either as a tumor-suppressors or oncogenes (75). A striking example of how one miRNA can drastically alter a cellular phenotype is mir-21 (76). This miRNA is overexpressed in a great number of tumor types and induction of mir-21 expression in vivo results in a pre-B malignant lymphoid-like phenotype. Upon subsequent inactivation of mir-21 expression, this phenotype completely regresses again within a few days, indicating that tumors can become addicted to oncogenic miRNAs and demonstrating the strength of a single miRNA to regulate cellular behavior.",

        "text": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1) is the most common form of inherited peripheral neuropathy. Although the disease is genetically heterogeneous, it has been demonstrated that the gene defect in the most frequent type (CMT1A) is the result of a partial duplication of band 17p11.2. Recent studies suggested that the peripheral hypomyelination syndrome in the trembler (Tr) mouse, a possible animal model for CMT1 disease, is associated with a point mutation in the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene (pmp-22). Expression of pmp-22 is particularly high in Schwann cells, and the protein is found in peripheral myelin. We now report that the human PMP-22 gene is contained within the CMT1A duplication. We therefore, suggest that increased dosage of the PMP-22 gene may be the cause of CMT1A neuropathy.",

        "text": "Background: Patients with schizophrenia have an increased risk of depressive disorders compared to the general population. The comorbidity between schizophrenia and depression suggests a potential coincidence of the pathophysiology and/or genetic predictors of these mental disorders. The aim of this study was to review the potential genetic predictors of schizophrenia and depression comorbidity. Materials and Methods: We carried out research and analysis of publications in the databases PubMed, Springer, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis Online, Science Direct, and eLIBRARY.RU using keywords and their combinations. The search depth was the last 10 years (2010-2020). Full-text original articles, reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical observations were analyzed. A total of 459 articles were found, of which 45 articles corresponding to the purpose of this study were analyzed in this topic review. Results: Overlap in the symptoms and genetic predictors between these disorders suggests that a common etiological mechanism may underlie the presentation of comorbid depression in schizophrenia. The molecular mechanisms linking schizophrenia and depression are polygenic. The most studied candidate genes are GRIN1, GPM6A, SEPTIN4, TPH1, TPH2, CACNA1C, CACNB2, and BCL9.Conclusion: Planning and conducting genome-wide and associative genetic studies of the comorbid conditions under consideration in psychiatry is important for the development of biological and clinical predictors and a personalized therapy strategy for schizophrenia. However, it should be recognized that the problems of predictive and personalized psychiatry in the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia and comorbid disorders are far from being resolved.",

        "text": "It has become apparent that somatic mutations or epimutations affecting miRNA-mediated silencing contribute to cancer. Dicer dysregulation and deletions of Argonaute genes have been reported in several types of tumor. miRNA levels have been found to be generally decreased in tumors, possibly marking de-differentiation. The downregulation or deletion of specific tumor-suppressing miRNAs (e.g. miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-143, miR-145 and let-7) and overexpression of putative oncogenic miRNAs (e.g. miR-21 and miR-155) might directly contribute to cancer progression. Oncogene tenors, including RAS, BCL2 and KIT, are targets of dysregulated miRNAs, whereas the miR-17-19b-1 cluster is involved in a complex interplay with MYC. Moreover, somatic mutations altering binding sites for miR-221, miR-222 and miR-146 have been observed in the 3\u2032 UTR of the KIT oncogene in papillary thyroid carcinoma. The contribution of somatic perturbations of RNA silencing to cancer has been reviewed recently [40] and will not be considered further here.",

Abnormal expression of lncRNAs is found in multiple diseases, and lncRNAs have been exploited for diverse medical applications. The lncRNA MIR210HG is a recently discovered lncRNA that is widely dysregulated in human disease. MIR210HG was described to have biological functions with potential roles in disease development, including cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and energy metabolism. And MIR210HG dysregulation was confirmed to have promising clinical values in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. In this review, we systematically summarize the expression profiles, roles, underlying mechanisms, and clinical applications of MIR210HG in human disease.",

        "text": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease characterized by musculoskeletal inflammation (arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis, and dactylitis), generally occurs in patients with psoriasis. PsA is also associated with uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). To capture these manifestations as well as the associated comorbidities, and to recognize their underlining common pathogenesis, the name of psoriatic disease was coined. The pathogenesis of PsA is complex and multifaceted, with an interplay of genetic predisposition, triggering environmental factors, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune system, although autoinflammation has also been implicated. Research has identified several immune-inflammatory pathways defined by cytokines (IL-23/IL-17, TNF), leading to the development of efficacious therapeutic targets. However, heterogeneous responses to these drugs occur in different patients and in the different tissues involved, resulting in a challenge to the global management of the disease. Therefore, more translational research is necessary in order to identify new targets and improve current disease outcomes. Hopefully, this may become a reality through the integration of different omics technologies that allow better understanding of the relevant cellular and molecular players of the different tissues and manifestations of the disease. In this narrative review, we aim to provide an updated overview of the pathophysiology, including the latest findings from multiomics studies, and to describe current targeted therapies.",

Awareness of the diagnosis is improving, and epidemiologic data are emerging. Recent findings: Recent studies suggest that FPIES may affect as many as 0.5% of children worldwide. FPIES in adults is usually triggered by seafood and may be more common than previously thought. Many patients with FPIES have other allergic disorders. Summary: With refined diagnostic criteria and improved awareness, FPIES is now diagnosed with increasing frequency, and epidemiologic data are emerging. FPIES appears to be increasing in prevalence, and the frequent association with other allergic disorders suggests a shared predisposition or immune mechanism that remains to be elucidated.",

Differential expressions of miRNAs are observed in psoriasis and the deregulated miRNAs are sometimes associated with disease severity. This study aims to identify miRNAs altered in the serum of psoriasis patients that are associated with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). In order to assess miRNA levels in the serum of psoriasis patients, we selected 24 differentially expressed miRNAs in the psoriatic skin are possibly derived from the skin and immune cells, as well as five miRNAs that are enriched in other tissues. We identified 16 miRNAs that exhibited significantly ( p < 0.05) altered levels in the serum of psoriasis patients compared to healthy individuals. Among these, 13 miRNAs showed similar expression pattern in the serum of psoriasis patients as also observed in the psoriatic skin tissues. Ten miRNAs showed an accuracy of greater than 75% in classifying the psoriasis patients from healthy individuals. Further analysis of differential miRNA levels between the low PASI group and the high PASI group identified three miRNAs (miR\u2010147b, miR\u20103614\u20105p, and miR\u2010125a\u20105p) with significantly altered levels between the low severity and the high severity psoriasis patients. Our systematic investigation of skin and immune cell\u2010derived miRNAs in the serum of psoriasis patients revealed alteration in miRNA levels to be associated with disease severity, which may help in monitoring the disease progression and therapeutic response.",

        "text": "MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that can bind to the target sites in the 3'-untranslated region of messenger RNA to regulate posttranscriptional gene expression. Increasing evidence has identified the miR-29 family, consisting of miR-29a, miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2, and miR-29c, as key regulators of a number of biological processes. Moreover, their abnormal expression contributes to the etiology of numerous diseases. In the current review, we aimed to summarize the differential expression patterns and functional roles of the miR-29 family in the etiology of diseases including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cardiorenal, and immune disease. Furthermore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting members of miR-29 family in these diseases. We present miR-29s as promoters of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis but suppressors of chondrogenic and osteoclast differentiation, fibrosis, and T cell differentiation, with clear avenues for therapeutic manipulation. Further research will be crucial to identify the precise mechanism of miR-29 family in these diseases and their full potential in therapeutics.",

MiR-155-5p is highly expressed in both activated B- and T-cells and in monocytes/macrophages. MiR-155-5p is one of the best characterized miRNAs and recent data indicate that miR-155-5p plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes such as hematopoietic lineage differentiation, immunity, inflammation, viral infections, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Down syndrome. In this review we summarize the mechanisms by which MIR155HG expression can be regulated. Given that the pathologies mediated by miR-155-5p result from the over-expression of this miRNA it may be possible to therapeutically attenuate miR-155-5p levels in the treatment of several pathological processes.",

Aberrant expression of miRNAs alters biological processes and pathways linked to human disease. miR-486-5p is a muscle-enriched miRNA localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is highly abundant in human plasma and enriched in small extracellular vesicles. Studies of malignant and non-malignant diseases, including kidney diseases, have found correlations with circulating miR-486-5p levels, supporting its role as a potential biomarker. Pre-clinical studies of non-malignant diseases have identified miR-486-5p targets that regulate major signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Validated miR-486-5p targets include phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and FoXO1, whose suppression activates phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Targeting of Smad1/2/4 and IGF-1 by miR-486-5p inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling, respectively. Other miR-486-5p targets include matrix metalloproteinase-19 (MMP-19), Sp5, histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1), and nuclear factor of activated T cells-5 (NFAT5).

        "text": "Introduction: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition resulting in lung and liver disease with a great clinical variability. MicroRNAs have been identified as disease modifiers; therefore miRNA deregulation could play an important role in disease heterogeneity. Members of miR-320 family are involved in regulating of multiple processes including inflammation, and have potential specific binding sites in the 3'UTR region of SERPINA1 gene. In this study we explore the involvement of miR-320c, a member of this family, in this disease. Methods: Firstly in vitro studies were carried out to demonstrate regulation of SERPINA1 gene by miR-320. Furthermore, the expression of miR-320c was analyzed in the blood of 98 individuals with different AAT serum levels by using quantitative PCR and expression was correlated to clinical parameters of the patients. Finally, HL60 cells were used to analyze induction of miR-320c in inflammatory conditions. Results: Overexpression of miR-320 members in human HepG2 cells led to inhibition of SERPINA1 expression. Analysis of miR-320c expression in patient's samples revealed significantly increased expression of miR-320c in individuals with pulmonary disease. Additionally, HL60 cells treated with the pro-inflammatory factor lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed increase in miR-320c expression, suggesting that miR-320c responds to inflammation. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that miR-320c inhibits SERPINA1 expression in a hepatic cell line and its levels in blood are associated with lung disease in a cohort of patients with different AAT serum levels. These results suggest that miR-320c can play a role in AAT regulation and could be a biomarker of inflammatory processes in pulmonary diseases.",

        "text": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. These antibodies are directly causing the muscular fatigue and weakness typical for MG by binding to their target and thereby inducing crosslinking of antigens, complement activation, increased degradation and blocked function 1-3. Myasthenia gravis is increasingly defined as a syndrome with several distinct disease subgroups. These subgroups differ regarding clinical presentation, pathogenesis, genetic predisposition and most probably also causative factors 1-3. The risk for various comorbid conditions would be expected to depend on MG subgroup because of these differences. Three antigenic targets for disease-inducing antibodies have been found in MG: acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4). All these molecules are necessary for neuromuscular transmission and they are functionally linked postsynaptically. In addition to autoantibody specificity, the subgrouping of MG is based on clinical manifestations including age at debut and thymus pathology (Table 1). Thymic lymphoepitheliomas are associated with MG in one-third of cases, whereas thymic hyperplasia is typical for early onset MG 4. The antibody-negative MG subgroup is the most heterogeneous, including some patients with low affinity and/or low concentration AChR, MuSK or LRP4 antibodies not detected by routine assays 1-3. Some probably have other types of autoantibodies against the postsynaptic membrane, and some may have non-autoantibody mediated (T cell mediated, other) disease.",

The variability in the prevalence of serological markers of HEV infection between different ethnic groups proposes a host genetic influence. Here, we report genetic polymorphisms associated with anti-HEV antibody positivity and level using binary- and quantitative-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on a population from Qatar (n = 5829). We identified a region in 12p11.1 (lead SNP: rs559856097, allele: A, p = 2.3 \u00d7 10-10) significantly associated with anti-HEV antibodies level. This intergenic variant is located near SNORD112, a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). Additional gene-set and pathway enrichment analyses highlighted a strong correlation with anti-viral response-related pathways, including IFNs (alpha/beta) and interleukin-21 (IL-21) signaling. This is the first GWAS on the response to HEV infection. Further replication and functional experimentation are warranted to validate these findings.",

        "text": "Results: Abruption cases were more likely to experience preeclampsia, have shorter gestational age, and deliver infants with lower birthweight compared with controls. Models with MFGI effects provided improved fit than models with only maternal and fetal genotype main effects for SNP rs12530904 (p-value = 1.2e-04) in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase [CaM kinase] II beta (CAMK2B), and, SNP rs73136795 (p-value = 1.9e-04) in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), both MB genes. We identified 320 SNPs in 45 maternally-imprinted genes (including potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 [KCNQ1], neurotrimin [NTM], and, ATPase phospholipid transporting 10 A [ATP10A]) associated with abruption. Top hits included rs2012323 (p-value = 1.6E-16) and rs12221520 (p-value1.3e-13) in KCNQ1, rs8036892 (p-value = 9.3E-17) and rs188497582 in ATP10A, rs12589854 (p-value = 2.9E-11) and rs80203467 (p-value = 4.6e-11) in maternally expressed 8, small nucleolar RNA host (MEG8), and rs138281088 in solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2) (p-value = 6.8e-9). Conclusions: We identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development.

        "text": "Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in America, and it holds the number 1 fatality rate of all cancers. Previous mRNA profiling studies have suggested many promising markers for early diagnosis and therapy in pancreatic cancer. However, the accuracy in distinguishing the tumor from normal samples is yet to improve [64\u201367]. With the discovery of miRNAs, more and more investigators are studying the miRNA signatures in pancreatic cancer. A recent profiling study using 28 pancreatic tumors, 15 adjacent benign tissues, 4 chronic pancreatitis specimens, 6 normal pancreas tissues, and 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines identified several miRNAs aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia, including miRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers, such as miR-155, miR-21, miR-221, and miR-222, as well as some not previously reported in cancers, such as miR-376a and miR-301. Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs are downregulated in tumor tissues [39]. Szafranska et al. [68] found that miR-205, -18a, -31, -93, -221, and -224 are over-expressed in both primary neoplastic ductal cells and in established pancreatic cancer cell lines. Therefore, these miRNAs may represent potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. They also identified 26 miRNAs most prominently misregulated in pancreatic cancer, and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) index using only miR-217 and -196a was found to discriminate between normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and cancer tissues, suggesting a potential utility for miRNAs in diagnostic procedures for pancreatic cancer. Another study investigating the global miRNA expression patterns in normal pancreas, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and acinar carcinomas indicated that the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumor from normal tissues [69]. A set of 10 miRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis. miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin. They also found that the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with cell proliferation and liver metastasis. The same study suggests that alteration in miRNA expression is related to endocrine and acinar neoplastic transformation and progression of malignancy. Bloomston et al. [70] found that 21 miRNAs with increased expression and 4 with decreased expression could differentiate pancreatic cancer from benign pancreatic tissues in 90% of samples by cross validation. Fifteen over-expressed and 8 downregulated miRNAs could differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis with 93% accuracy. A subgroup of 6 miRNAs was able to distinguish long-term survivors with node-positive disease from patients who would die within 24 months. They also found that high expression of miR-196a-2 could predict poor survival (14.3 months versus 26.5 months) of pancreatic cancer patients.",

        "text": "In animal systems, miRNAs can regulate gene expression through either the inhibition of protein translation or initiation of mRNA degradation (6). This is a major difference with the plant kingdom, where miRNAs form highly complementary Watson-Crick base pairing with the target mRNA and subsequently solely induce mRNA cleavage (45). Nonetheless, in animals there seems to be a correlation with the extent of base-pairing between the miRNA and its target, and subsequent cleavage or translational repression (46). In mammals, there are four members of the Argonaute family (AGO1-4) (47), of which only AGO2 has mRNA cleavage (\u201cslicer\u201d) activity and is also the only AGO protein that functions in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway by cleaving the mRNA in the center of the mRNA-siRNA duplex (47, 48). Interestingly, there is also an miRNA mir-451, whose maturation is directly regulated by the slicer activity of AGO2. Instead of Dicer, this pre-miRNA is cleaved by AGO2 and likely subsequently polyuridylated and trimmed into the mature miR-451 sequence (49). There is thus a close interplay between miRNA production and activity. Besides the slicer activity of AGO2, miRISCs containing either AGO2 or other AGO proteins can cause a reduction in the protein output without directly diminishing the mRNA levels. In these instances, reduction in protein expression is caused by interfering with the translational machinery.",

        "text": "Among the six lncRNA involved in our signature, AC099329.2 and DNMBP-AS1 were protective lncRNA in HCC patients, while AC138904.1, DEPDC1-AS1, GIHCG, and AC145343.1 were risk lncNRAs. AC099329.2 and DNMBP-AS1 have been reported to be strongly associated with ferroptosis and could be used as a novel biomarker for predicting Breast Cancer prognosis39,40, and DEPDC1-AS1 has also been shown to be significantly correlated with ferroptosis and may serve as a good prognostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma41,42. However, their functions and mechanisms of them have not been reported so far in HCC. AC145343.1 can be involved in the regulation of immune cell infiltration as TP53 mutation-associated lncRNA and predict HCC patient prognosis43,44. High GIHCG expression was linked to a shorter patient survival time and was also an independent predictive factor for overall survival in HCC45, which was in line with our findings. Knocking down GIHCG dramatically suppressed HCC cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and was predicted to be a novel target for HCC treatment46. Moreover, a high level of GIHCG expression was also a biomarker for Lapatinib resistance47. GIHCG has also been shown to be involved in the development of a variety of tumors including breast48, ovarian49, cervical50, esophageal51, colorectal52, and gastric53 cancers. In this study, we found that the expression of AC138904.1, AC099329.2, and DNMBP-AS1 was significantly changed before and after drug treatment in both HerpG2 and MHCC-97H cells in the constructed Cuproptosis cell model and might be involved in the development of HCC through the mechanism of Cuproptosis, and further studies are needed to confirm this result.",

        "text": "Introduction: We explored microRNA (miRNA) profiles correlated with the penumbra in three different phases of ischaemic stroke, using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (p-MCAO) rat model. Materials and methods: A 2-mm coronal section was cut from the optic chiasma in the caudal direction, and the penumbra was located in the area between a longitudinal line approximately 2 mm from the midline and a transverse diagonal line at the 2-o'clock position. Total RNA was extracted from tissue specimens and peripheral blood samples, followed by deep sequencing analysis. Results: We identified nine novel miRNA candidates in tissues and evaluated their expression levels using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In situ hybridization was conducted to assess miRNA localization in the brain. Of these nine candidates, we identified and characterized a novel miRNA, rno-miR-686-3p, which was localized in cell nuclei of the cortex, and associated with the penumbra. rno-miR-686-3p was downregulated at 1 (p = 0.042), 3 (p = 0.032), and 4 h (p = 0.007) post-p-MCAO in the penumbra. A total of 297 potential target genes were predicted. Moreover, functional annotation clustering and pathway enrichment analysis predicted that rno-miR-686-3p participates in transcriptional regulation and the Wnt and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathways. Conclusion: rno-miR-686-3p is a novel miRNA associated with the ischaemic penumbra that is implicated in transcriptional regulation and modulation of the Wnt and cAMP signalling pathways. Furthermore, it may serve as a possible new biomarker with potential value for detecting the existence of the penumbra.",

        "text": "Background: Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides, have been involved in several biological processes and in a growing number of diseases, controlling gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing, the transport of mature mRNAs to specific cellular compartments, the regulation of mRNA stability, protein translation and turnover. The fundamental role of lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) is becoming increasingly evident. LncRNAs are abundantly expressed in mammalian CNS in a specific spatio-temporal manner allowing a quick response to environmental/molecular changes. Methods: This article reviews the biology and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs underlying their potential role in CNS and in some neurodegenerative diseases. Results: an increasing number of studies report on lncRNAs involvement in different molecular mechanisms of gene expression modulation in CNS, from neural stem cell differentiation mainly by chromatin remodeling, to control of neuronal activities. More recently, lncRNAs have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, where the role of BACE1-AS lncRNA has been widely defined. BACE1-AS levels are up-regulated in AD brains where BACE1-AS acts by stabilizing BACE1 mRNA thereby increasing BACE1 protein content and A\u03b242 formation. In Frontotemporal dementia and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the lncRNAs NEAT1_2 and MALAT1 co-localize at nuclear paraspeckles with TDP-43 and FUS proteins and their binding to TDP-43 is markedly increased in affected brains. In Parkinson's Disease the lncRNA UCHL1-AS1 acts by directly promoting translation of UCHL1 protein leading to perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Different lncRNAs, such as HTT-AS, BDNF-AS and HAR1, were found to be dysregulated in their expression also in Huntington's Disease. In Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients, the presence of CGG repeats expansion alters the expression of the lncRNAs FMR1-AS1 and FMR6. Interestingly, they are expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting these lncRNAs may represent biomarkers for FXS/FXTAS early detection and therapy. Finally, the identification of the antisense RNAs SCAANT1-AS and ATXN8OS in spinocerebellar ataxia 7 and 8, respectively, suggests that very different mechanisms of action driven by lncRNAs may trigger neurodegeneration in these disorders. Conclusion: The emerging role of lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases suggests that their dysregulation could trigger neuronal death via still unexplored RNA-based regulatory mechanisms which deserve further investigation. The evaluation of their diagnostic significance and therapeutic potential could also address the setting up of novel treatments in diseases where no cure is available to date.",

        "text": "In the United States, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men with an approximately 220,000 patients diagnosed with the disease in 2015. Prostate cancer is a hormone-driven tumor, and a common therapy is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) that involves anti-androgen treatments and/or castration therapy. Understanding the molecular basis for androgen-independent tumors is crucial toward developing new therapies for these patients. Understanding how androgen receptor itself functions is an important step in elucidating this process. Androgen receptor (AR), NR3C4, is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the expression of protein-coding genes. Translocation of AR to improper gene promoter elements or DNA-binding sites can result in an alteration in gene expression and thus normal prostate function. Therefore, it is crucial to understand which AR-promoter interactions are drivers of disease, as compared to promiscuous or benign AR-binding interactions. While a large portion of our genome is considered a gene desert, it is now appreciated that these regions of the genome contain non-coding RNA genes such as microRNAs (miRNAs). These non-coding RNAs have enormous regulatory potential, as they post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to promote degradation or intervention of translational processes. In this review, we focus specifically on the notion that mis-regulation of non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs by improper AR-DNA binding are an important component that promotes prostate cancer. We also highlight the role of miR-206 and the interaction of miR-206 and AR within this process, given this is a miRNA known to be regulated by hormones in both breast and prostate cancer.",

        "text": "Background: Celiac disease, an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs in susceptible individuals after gluten ingestion, has clinical manifestations that go beyond the classical malabsorption syndrome and can affect other systems. Objective: To review the current literature for cardiovascular changes described in patients with celiac disease. Method: We conducted a search in the PubMed database and selected articles based on their relevance to the objective. Results: Celiac patients have a 1.2 times higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to non-celiac patients. The most common cardiovascular manifestations include atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation), myocarditis, coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, impaired aortic function, and cerebrovascular diseases. There are several possible explanations for this relationship, including: prothrombotic changes, accelerated atherosclerosis compared to patients without celiac disease, associated comorbidities, such as antiphospholipid syndrome and Type 1 Diabetes mellitus, subclinical chronic inflammation and genetic factors. Celiac disease patients have a 38% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation and a 19% higher risk of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, celiac patients have a 22% higher risk of coronary artery disease-related death, regardless of small intestine histopathology. Patients with celiac disease also show an increased prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy (5.7%) and a 73% higher risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly within the first year of celiac disease diagnosis. Conclusion: Celiac disease may be associated with cardiovascular changes, especially in newly diagnosed patients who have not adhered to a gluten-free diet. Therefore, cardiovascular assessment should be considered as part of the initial assessment and follow-up of individuals with celiac disease.",

        "text": "Explaining the genetics of many diseases is challenging because most associations localize to incompletely characterized regulatory regions. Using new computational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy multiple loci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein\u2013Barr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene\u2013environment interaction. Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins.",

        "text": "Background: Increasing evidence supports the role of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as master gene regulators at the epigenetic modification level. However, the underlying mechanism of these functional ncRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been well investigated. Methods: The dysregulated expression profiling of lncRNAs-snoRNAs-mRNAs and their correlations and co-expression enrichment were assessed by GeneChip microarray analysis. The candidate lncRNAs, snoRNAs, and target genes were detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), RT-PCR, qPCR and immunofluorescence (IF) assays. The biological functions of these factors were investigated using in vitro and in vivo studies that included CCK8, trans-well, cell apoptosis, IF assay, western blot method, and the xenograft mice models. rRNA 2'-O-methylation (Me) activities were determined by the RTL-P assay and a novel double-stranded primer based on the single-stranded toehold (DPBST) assay. The underlying molecular mechanisms were explored by bioinformatics and RNA stability, RNA fluorescence ISH, RNA pull-down and translation inhibition assays. Results: To demonstrate the involvement of lncRNA and snoRNAs in 2'-O-Me modification during tumorigenesis, we uncovered a previously unreported mechanism linking the snoRNPs NOP58 regulated by ZFAS1 in control of SNORD12C, SNORD78 mediated rRNA 2'-O-Me activities in CRC initiation and development. Specifically, ZFAS1 exerts its oncogenic functions and significantly up-regulated accompanied by elevated NOP58, SNORD12C/78 expression in CRC cells and tissues. ZFAS1 knockdown suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, and increased cell apoptosis, and this inhibitory effect could be reversed by NOP58 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the NOP58 protein could be recognized by the specific motif (AAGA or CAGA) of ZFAS1. This event accelerates the assembly of SNORD12C/78 to allow for further guiding of 2'-O-Me at the corresponding Gm3878 and Gm4593 sites. Importantly, silencing SNORD12C or 78 reduced the rRNAs 2'-O-Me activities, which could be rescued by overexpression ZFAS1, and this subsequently inhibits the RNA stability and translation activity of their downstream targets (e.g., EIF4A3 and LAMC2). Conclusion: The novel ZFAS1-NOP58-SNORD12C/78-EIF4A3/LAMC2 signaling axis that functions in CRC tumorigenesis provides a better understanding regarding the role of lncRNA-snoRNP-mediated rRNAs 2'-O-Me activities for the prevention and treatment of CRC.",

        "text": "Background & aims: Single nucleotide polymorphisms could affect risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a germline copy number variation (CNV)-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) in populations of Chinese ancestry to search for germline CNVs that increase risk of HCC. Methods: We conducted a CNV-based GWAS of 1583 HCC cases (persons with chronic HBV infection and HCC) and 1540 controls (persons with chronic HBV infection without HCC) in Chinese populations. Identified candidates were expressed in L-02, HepG2, or TP53-/- or wild-type HCT116 cells, and knocked down with short hairpin RNAs in HepG2, Bel-7402, and SMMC-7721 cells; proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis were measured. Formation of xenograft tumors from cell lines was monitored in nude mice. Subcellular localization of ribosome proteins and levels or activity of p53 were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Levels of small nucleolar RNA H/ACA box 18-like 5 (SNORA18L5) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: We identified a low-frequency duplication at chromosome 15q13.3 strongly associated with risk of HBV-related HCC (overall P = 3.17 \u00d7 10-8; odds ratio, 12.02). Copy numbers of the 15q13.3 duplication correlated with the expression of SNORA18L5 in liver tissues. Overexpression of SNORA18L5 increased HCC cell proliferation and growth of xenograft tumors in mice; knockdown reduced HCC proliferation and tumor growth. SNORA18L5 overexpression in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells inhibited p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Overexpression of SNORA18L5 led to hyperactive ribosome biogenesis, increasing levels of mature 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs and causing the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11 to stay in the nucleolus, which kept them from binding to MDM2. This resulted in increased MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Levels of SNORA18L5 were increased in HCC tissues compared with nontumor liver tissues and associated with shorter survival times of patients. Conclusions: In a CNV-based GWAS, we associated duplication at 15q13.3 with increased risk of HBV-related HCC. We found SNORA18L5 at this location to promote HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. SNORA18L5 increases ribosome biogenesis, facilitates ribosomal RNA maturation, and alters localization of RPL5 and RPL11, allowing for increased MDM2-mediated proteolysis of p53 and cell cycle arrest.

        "text": "Cardiac hypertrophy in humans is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in cardiovascular diseases. Because miRNAs are important regulators for the differentiation and growth of cardiac cells, they are hypothesized to have an important role in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Indeed, several recent reports have found aberrant expression of miRNAs in diseased hearts and vessels. miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-195, miR-199a, and miR-214 were upregulated during cardiac hypertrophy, and their over-expression in cardiomyocytes in vitro caused an induction of hypertrophic growth. Interestingly, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, miR-199a, and miR-214 were similarly upregulated in the tissue of patients with end-stage failing human hearts. Cardiac arrhythmias are still considered a serious health problem because of their sudden, unpredictable and potentially fatal nature. In human hearts with coronary heart disease and the rat model of myocardial infarction, it has been shown that the muscle-specific miRNA (miR-1) is upregulated in ischaemic heart tissue. Furthermore, the results of this study show that the injection of mature miR-1 exacerbates arrhythmogenesis, whereas inhibition of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor suppresses arrhythmias. When the genes for the ion channels GJA1 and KCNJ2 were silenced, these proteins were shown to be important in mediating the miR-1-induced arrhythmogenic effect. The investigation into the role of miRNAs as a novel class of gene regulators in cardiovascular disease is a new frontier for research and it is hoped that the next decade will bring a greater understanding to their functions in cardiovascular biology.",

        "text": "Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both degenerative diseases. Osteoporosis often proceeds cognitive deficits, and multiple studies have revealed common triggers that lead to energy deficits in brain and bone. Risk factors for osteoporosis and AD, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, aging, chemotherapy, vitamin deficiency, alcohol abuse, and apolipoprotein E\u03b54 and/or Il-6 gene variants, reduce cellular glucose uptake, and protective factors, such as estrogen, insulin, exercise, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, hydrogen sulfide, and most phytochemicals, increase uptake. Glucose uptake is a fine-tuned process that depends on an abundance of glucose transporters (Gluts) on the cell surface. Gluts are stored in vesicles under the plasma membrane, and protective factors cause these vesicles to fuse with the membrane, resulting in presentation of Gluts on the cell surface. This translocation depends mainly on AKT kinase signaling and can be affected by a range of factors. Reduced AKT kinase signaling results in intracellular glucose deprivation, which causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and iron depletion, leading to activation of HIF-1\u03b1, the transcription factor necessary for higher Glut expression. The link between diseases and aging is a topic of growing interest. Here, we show that diseases that affect the same biochemical pathways tend to co-occur, which may explain why osteoporosis and/or diabetes are often associated with AD.",

        "text": "Purpose: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is characterized by early metastasis and late diagnosis. miR-29c-3p is confirmed to repress angiogenesis in multiple tumor types. Yet, the functions of miR-29c-3p in the mechanism of ESCC angiogenesis, which were not sufficiently explored previously, were exactly what we investigated here at the molecular level. Methods: The mRNA level of miR-29c-3p and Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade H member 1 (SERPINH1) in ESCC tissues were assessed via bioinformatics analysis. Thereafter, miR-29c-3p and SERPINH1 (HSP47) mRNA level in ESCC cell lines was evaluated via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effects of abnormal miR-29c-3p and SERPINH1 expression on ESCC cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and HUVEC angiogenesis were examined via CCK8, colony formation, transwell, and angiogenesis assays, respectively. The protein levels of SERPINH1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), Wnt-1, ?-catenin, and p-?-catenin were evaluated via Western blot. Expression of VEGFA secreted by ESCC cells was measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with the Wnt activator BML-284 further revealed the way miR-29c-3p mediated the Wnt signaling pathway and its effects on angiogenesis. Results: Herein, we revealed a decrease of miR-29c-3p expression in ESCC tissues and cells, while the overexpressed miR-29c-3p could remarkably suppress ESCC cell progression, as well as HUVEC angiogenesis. Meanwhile, overexpressed miR-29c-3p notably downregulated VEGFA and repressed the Wnt signaling pathway. Treatment with the Wnt activator BML-284 could reverse the inhibition of HUVEC angiogenesis caused by miR-29c-3p. SERPINH1 was a downstream target of miR-29c-3p. SERPINH1 knockdown suppressed the malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells and impeded the Wnt signaling activation, while such suppression was reversed through miR-29c-3p inhibitor. Conclusions: We confirmed the mechanism that miR-29c-3p targeted SERPINH1, thus regulating angiogenesis in ESCC through the Wnt signaling pathway. It improves the understanding of angiogenesis in ESCC and offers new ideas for the research of ESCC treatment strategies in the future.",

        "text": "Several studies have reported that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were associated with the progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the role and regulation mechanism of lncRNA122049 in ischemic AKI remains unknown. In the present study, we found that lncRNA 122049 protected against the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced apoptosis in BUMPT cells. Mechanistically, the lncRNA 122049 directly sponged miR-330-5p, then increased the expression of ELK1(ETS transcription factor ELK1) to decrease renal cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-330-5p inhibitor completely reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of LncRNA 122049 siRNA on I/R-induced BUMPT cells apoptosis. Finally, overexpression of lncRNA 122049 attenuated ischemic mice AKI via targeting of the miR-330-5p/ELK1 axis. Collectively, the data demonstrated that LncRNA 122049 prevented the I/R-induced renal cell apoptosis via regulation of the miR-330-5p/ELK1 axis, which brings new insights into the pathogenesis and potential targeted treatment of ischemic AKI.",

        "text": "The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. The gene coding for pri-miR-21 (primary transcript containing miR-21) is located within the intronic region of the TMEM49 gene. Despite pri-miR-21 and TMEM49 are overlapping genes in the same direction of transcription, pri-miR-21 is independently transcribed by its own promoter regions and terminated with its own poly(A) tail. After transcription, primiR- 21 is finally processed into mature miR-21. Expression of miR-21 has been found to be deregulated in almost all types of cancers and therefore was classified as an oncomiR. During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. MiR-21 additionally regulates various immunological and developmental processes. Due to the critical functions of its target proteins in various signaling pathways, miR-21 has become an attractive target for genetic and pharmacological modulation in various disease conditions.",

        "text": "Background: With hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) becoming a heavy disease burden in China, it is particular to reveal its pathological mechanism. Recent researches have indicated that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) may be involved in various cancers including HCC. Polymorphisms within snoRNAs may affect its function or expression level, and even its host gene, then produce series of effects related to itself or its host gene. Methods: The association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2305789 in SNORD105 with HCC susceptibility was evaluated in two independent case-control sets (712 HCC and 801 controls). The contribution of rs2305789 to HCC risk was investigated using case-control, genotype-phenotype correlation analysis, and functional assays. Results: The SNP rs2305789 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC in both case-control sets (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.93, p = 0.003). Compared with the AA genotype, the GG genotype was significantly correlated with lower expression of both SNORD105 and PPAN (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the overexpressed SNORD105 up-regulated PPAN expression level (p < 0.05). Finally, the in vivo experiment showed that the overexpressed SNORD105 increased cell viability and motility in both HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines (p < 0.05). Conclusions: To sum up, our results suggested that rs2305789 decreased the risk of HCC by reducing the expression of both SNORD105 and PPAN, which reduced HCC cell viability and motility.",

        "text": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is routinely assessed as a marker of systemic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is also an immune regulator that plays an important role in inflammatory pathways associated with RA and promotes atherogenic effects. Comorbidities linked to systemic inflammation are common in RA, and CRP has been associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, pulmonary diseases, and depression. The relationship between systemic inflammation, CRP, and comorbidities in RA is complex, and it is challenging to determine how changing CRP levels may affect the risk or progression of these comorbidities. We review the biological role of CRP in RA and its implications for disease activity and treatment response. We also discuss the impact of treatment on CRP levels and whether reducing systemic inflammation and inhibiting CRP-mediated inflammatory pathways may have an impact on conditions commonly comorbid with RA.",

        "text": "A network of gene regulatory factors such as transcription factors and microRNAs establish and maintain gene expression patterns during hematopoiesis. In this network, transcription factors regulate each other and are involved in regulatory loops with microRNAs. The microRNA cluster miR-17-92 is located within the MIR17HG gene and encodes six mature microRNAs. It is important for hematopoietic differentiation and plays a central role in malignant disease. However, the transcription factors downstream of miR-17-92 are largely elusive and the transcriptional regulation of miR-17-92 is not fully understood. Here we show that miR-17-92 forms a regulatory loop with the transcription factor TAL1. The miR-17-92 cluster inhibits expression of TAL1 and indirectly leads to decreased stability of the TAL1 transcriptional complex. We found that TAL1 and its heterodimerization partner E47 regulate miR-17-92 transcriptionally. Furthermore, miR-17-92 negatively influences erythroid differentiation, a process that depends on gene activation by the TAL1 complex. Our data give example of how transcription factor activity is fine-tuned during normal hematopoiesis. We postulate that disturbance of the regulatory loop between TAL1 and the miR-17-92 cluster could be an important step in cancer development and progression.",

        "text": "The pathway analysis revealed a statistically significant enrichment for proteins involved in the type I diabetes mellitus pathway. To demonstrate the ability of our miRNA\u2013protein\u2013disease associations to pinpoint potentially causal proteins, we examined the links between miRNAs and diabetes in more detail. sFor the medium-confidence miRNA\u2013disease associations based on the TargetScan miRNA\u2013protein associations, 64 miRNAs are associated with diabetes mellitus. Of these, the four members of the miR-181 family (miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c and miR-181d) stand out, ranking fifth to eight most diabetes-related miRNAs in that prediction set. MicroRNA-181 is known from the literature to be associated with diabetes (Li et al., 2011). The protein that most strongly connects miR-181 to diabetes mellitus is glutamate decarboxylase 2, which is one of the eight proteins also found on the type I diabetes mellitus pathway (Table 2). Another protein that stands out is sirtuin-1, which ranks 9th, 9th, 7th and 8th for miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c and miR-181d, respectively. It is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase that acts as a positive regulator of insulin signaling (Liang et al., 2009). Moreover, it has been shown that downregulation of miR-181a upregulates sirtuin-1 and increases insulin sensitivity in hepatic cells (Zhou et al., 2012). This illustrates that using the protein-driven miRNA\u2013disease associations not only reveals potentially new miRNAs involved in diseases but also provides candidate proteins as molecular hypotheses underpinning the associations, which can be tested, e.g. through knockdown of the mRNA or mutagenesis of the miRNA target region.",

        "text": "LncRNA ZNF667-AS1 plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of various cancers. However, their role in colon cancer (CC) remains unclear. The expression of ZNF667-AS1, KIF5C, and miR-523-3p in CC cells and tissues was analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. CCK-8 scratch-wound assay, western blotting, and flow cytometry were conducted to investigate the malignant activity of CC in vitro. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and Ago2 immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were conducted to ascertain the association of miR-523-3p with ZNF667-AS1 and KIF5C 3'UTR. Xenograft tumor experiments were also performed. CC cells and tissues showed low expression of NF667-AS1 and KIF5C and elevated expression of miR-523-3p. ZNF667-AS1 overexpression attenuates proliferation and migration of CC cells, restores inactivated apoptosis in vitro, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. MiR-523-3p targets both ZNF667-AS1 and the KIF5C 3'UTR. ZNF667-AS1 overexpression in SW480 and SW620 cells attenuated the oncogenic effect of miR-523-3p in CC. However, this attenuating effect was counteracted by KIF5C overexpression. ZNF667-AS1 sequestered miR-523-3, reducing miR-523-3p-mediated inhibition of KIF5C expression, thereby repressing colon carcinogenesis in vitro. Our findings shed light on a novel anticancer strategy that could potentially combat CC.",

        "text": "The generation of cardiac disease-like phenotypes in animal models may not only be caused by a global alteration of miRNA function but also by the dysfunction of specific miRNAs. For instance, miR-1-2 appears to be involved in the regulation of diverse cardiac and skeletal muscle functions, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac conduction and arrhythmias [63]. miR-1, together with another heart-specific miRNA (miR-133a), is known to be transcribed by a duplicated bicistronic genetic locus (miR-1-1/miR133a-2 and miR-1-2/miR133a-1) sharing identical sequences of the mature miRNAs. Mice lacking miR-1-2 present a spectrum of abnormalities, ranging from ventricular septal defects and early lethality to cardiac rhythm disturbances. These mice also featured a striking cell-cycle abnormality in myocytes, leading to hyperplasia of the heart with nuclear division persisting postnatally. Remarkably, the persistence in these mice of the other identical copy of miR-1-2 (that is, miR-1-1) did not compensate for the loss of miR-1-2, at least for many aspects of its function. While it is likely that mice lacking both miR-1-1 and miR-1-2 will have increasingly severe abnormalities, the range of defects upon the deletion of miR-1-2 highlighted the ability of miRNAs to regulate multiple diverse targets in vivo [63]. The subtle dysregulation of numerous developmental genes may contribute to the embryonic defects observed in miR-1-2 mutants. These included: (1) Hrt2/Hey2, a member of the Hairy family of transcriptional repressors that mediates Notch signalling, which can itself cause heart disease [64]; and (2) Hand1, a bHLH transcription factor involved in ventricular development and septation that, in combination with Hand2 (a paralog of Hand1), is known to regulate expansion of the embryonic cardiac ventricles in a gene dosage-dependent manner [65]. Furthermore, in miR-1-2 mutants, the observed abnormality in the propagation of cardiac electrical activity, despite normal anatomy and function, was correlated with the upregulation of the direct target Irx5, a transcription factor, resulting in ventricular repolarization abnormalities and a predisposition to arrhythmias.",

Inhibiting miR-543 can protect osteoblasts by upregulating YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) and interfering with the AKT/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which is beneficial to the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis (X. Li, Ning, Zhao, & Wan, 2018). LncRNA PVT1 specifically silenced miR-543 in rheumatoid arthritis, and miR-543 negatively regulated signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) expression, thereby inhibiting proliferation and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion, while promoting apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (J. Wang, Kong, et al., 2020). And miR-543 targets the dioxygenases ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) and 2 (TET2) in myelofibrosis models, upregulation of miR-543 promotes the expression of genes related to drug metabolism, including CYP3A4 (Fuentes-Mattei et al., 2020). Keloids are benign fibroproliferative dermal tumors. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist inhibits the expression of early growth response-1 (Egr1) by upregulating the expression of miR-543, thereby inhibiting collagen synthesis of scar fibroblasts (Zhu et al., 2016).",

Whereas TH1 and TH2 cells and their functions are well characterized, IL-17\u2013producing TH17 cells were only recently introduced as a separate lineage, orchestrating neutrophilic inflammation and enlarging the T-cell immunology picture.15, 16 We recently described TH17 as the predominant T-effector cells in a group of Asian patients with polyps, resulting in the predominance of neutrophil granulocytes.3, 5 Here we show that IL-17 also is expressed in individual white patients with nasal polyps, whereas IL-5 protein is found in a minority of Asian patients with polyps only. Although the expression pattern of T-effector cell cytokines in Chinese and Belgian polyp samples were remarkably different, with only 16% of the patients expressing IL-5 protein in the Chinese population versus 83% in the Belgian population, IL-5 protein was identified as the main positive determinant for eosinophilic inflammation in both groups.",

        "text": "The hematopoietic system is one of the first complex tissues to form in the developing mammalian embryo (Dzierzak and Speck 2008). Haematopoiesis, a highly regulated life-long process, generates differentiated blood cells in the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue (Shivdasani and Orkin 1996). The differentiation is strongly regulated by various factors including TFs, miRNAs and their concerted combinatorial action. miR-223, associated with granulocytic differentiation, is regulated by two transcription factors, namely, NFI-A and C/EBP\u03b1. NFI-A downregulates miR-223 and C/EBP\u03b1 induces the expression of miR-223 leading to granulocytic differentiation (Gronostajski 2000; Radomska et al. 1998). However, NFI-A is repressed by miR-223 through a feedback loop formation (Fazi et al. 2005). In addition, another such example is observed during monocyte-macrophage maturation where transcription factor AML1 has been found to regulate expression of many haematopoietic genes by downregulating the expression of miR 17-5p-92 and 106a-92 cluster, and in turn serving as a target to these miRNAs (Fontana et al. 2007). During maturation, the miRNAs are downregulated causing an increased expression of AML1, which further downregulates the miRNAs. Hence, the regulatory loops maintain the cycle of differentiation and generation of different blood cells.",

        "text": "miR-30 family members are also involved in the pathological process of renal diseases [46]. For example, Wu et al. found that glucocorticoid-sustained miR-30 expression was associated with reduced Notch1 activation and alleviated podocytes damage, accompanied with altered expression of Notch1 and p53 [21], indicating the important role of miR-30 family in renal diseases. In line with this finding, Wu et al. further found that some critical components of calcium/calcineurin signaling, including TRPC6, PPP3CA, PPP3CB, PPP3R1, and NFATC3, were the targets of miR-30 family. Moreover, podocyte-specific expression of the miR-30 sponge in mice increased calcium/calcineurin pathway component protein expression and calcineurin activity [47]. Notably, recent evidence further showed that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) could inhibit the expression of miR-30d through a Smad2/3-HDAC3-NcoR repression complex and provide new insights into a potential target for the treatment of podocytes injury-associated glomerulopathies [22]. In addition, it has been reported that the levels of miR-30 family members (including miR-30a, miR-30c, and miR-30e) increased in the plasma of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) rats compared with their levels in non-CIN control rats, suggesting that miR-30 family might serve as early biomarkers and target candidates for CIN [48]. Moreover, miR-30c was also involved in the regulation of renal tubular cell apoptosis in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, which provided a new therapeutic strategy for the improvement of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity [49].",

Direct sequencing of exon 17 (ref. 5) in affected individuals from this family has revealed a base change producing a Val \u2192 Gly substitution, also at codon 717. The occurrence of a second allelic variant at codon 717 linked to the Alzheimer's phenotype supports the hypothesis that they are pathogenic mutations.",

Heart disease was identified as a risk factor for mortality in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. Adults with CHD, which affects more than 1.5 million people in the United States [7] and 2.5 million in Europe [8], are recognized as a high-morbidity population, susceptible to a variety of cardiovascular deterioration and dysfunction. As a result, these individuals are widely seen as high-risk, and they must adapt to a highly limited lifestyle and career choices. A recent clinical study involving 105 patients has indicated that patients with congenital cardiac defects such as cyanotic lesions, and unrepaired cyanotic defects (Eisenmenger syndrome), were at much higher risk if infected by SARS-CoV-2 [4]. The ACE2 receptor has been demonstrated to have a greater affinity for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV. This, along with the presence of ACE2 on myocardial cells, may help explain how COVID-19 impacts the cardiovascular system (CVS) by accessing these cells and causing direct toxicity.",

        "text": "The unique aberrant (up- or down) expression of specific miRNAs in a specific disease state suggests new targets and strategies for gene therapy. As the expression profiles of miRNAs in certain diseases, by overexpression or down-regulation of the specific miRNAs it may become possible to treat and perhaps even cure the specific genetic disease. miRNAs as a target for gene therapy Cancers Cancer is one of the most obstinate group of diseases currently and in the past several decades. To date, the most popular therapeutic tool is surgical removal of the tumour with subsequent chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. However, the cure rate is low, particularly for a majority of malignant tumours. The surprising aberrant expression of specific miRNAs in a specific cancer type suggests that those miRNAs may serve as a novel target for cancer treatment and a possible new approach for gene therapy. Let-7 is a remarkable miRNA in lung cancer. Several investigations demonstrated that let-7 expression level is associated with the pathogenesis of lung cancer and the expression of let-7 is significantly reduced in lung cancer tissues [109\u2013114]. Takamizawa et al. (2004) found that let-7 was poorly expressed in lung cancers and reduced let-7 expression was significantly associated with shortened after operative survival independent of disease stage [114]. More interesting and importantly, an in vitro study show that transient overexpression of miRNA let-7 in the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation [114]. Recent studies indicate that let-7 inhibits tumour growth by targeting several oncogenes including RAS and high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2) [109, 111, 112, 114, 115]. Hmgo2 was found to be expressed in a wide variety of benign and malignant tumours [116\u2013122] and overexpression of HMGA2 gene caused the onset of specific tumours [123]. miRNA let-7 regulates the HMGA2 gene expression by binding to seven conserved HMGA2 3\u2019 UTR complementary sites [2, 111]. Disrupting the bind pairing between let-7 and HMGA2 caused HMGA2 overexpression, which enhanced anchorage-independent growth in several cell lines, and further promoted oncogenic transformation [112]. These results suggest that over-expressing miRNA let-7 may inhibit lung cancer growth and even cure lung cancer in the future. However, this possibility still needs to be tested in vivo in a live animal model, and finally in clinical trials. Cardiac diseases Cardiac disease is one primary cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries as well as the most frequent reason for non-infectious mortality in infants [124\u2013126]. Recently, several investigations demonstrated that miRNAs play an important role in cardiac development and contractility, and several heart diseases are associated with the aberrant expression of certain miRNAs [124, 127\u2013133]. Cardiac-specific overexpression of miR-1 inhibits cardiomyocyte in the embryonic heart [133] and exacerbated arrhythmogenesis [131]. In contrast, inhibiting miR-1 expression in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis [131]. These suggest that miR-1 may have an important pathophysiological functions in heart failure and may serve as a potential antiarrhythmic target for gene therapy. Recent studies show that another miRNA, miR-133, was associated with cardiac hypertrophy [129, 132, 134, 135]. Overexpression of miR-133 inhibits hypertrophic symptom in both neonatal and adult mouse myocytes [132]. In contrast, down regulation of miR-133 enhances hypertrophic growth in mouse heart [132]. This suggests that miR-133 controls the pathogenesis of heart hypertrophy and overexpressing miR-133 in heart hypertrophic patients may serve as a novel gene therapy for preventing pathological cardiac hypertrophy.",

        "text": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of epigenetic mechanisms [57]. Expression of Xist, arguably the best-characterized lncRNA, \u2018coats\u2019 the X chromosome in females to silence gene expression [58]. Thus, Xist is critical for maintaining dose compensation between genders. A recent study by Patil et al. suggested that Xist is a target of m6A regulation and that chemical modifications on Xist are required for its function [59]. Mapping m6A sites at high resolution using m6A individual nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) showed 78 putative m6A sites on XIST near the A repeat region. The authors further surmised that Xist-binding partners, RBM15 and RBM15B, are required for gene silencing by guiding the m6A methylation complex to the RNA. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed a robust interaction between RBM15/RBM15B and METTL3 in a WTAP-dependent manner. Using a doxycycline-inducible Xist expression system, knockdown of either RBM15 or RBM15B did not achieve silencing of the Xist targets Gpc4 and Atrx, whereas Rbm15/Rbm15b double knockdown resulted in a substantial increase in Gpc4 and Atrx transcription. These results suggest that RBM15 and RBM15B have redundant functions. In addition, knockdown of Rbm15/Rbm15b significantly reduced the amount of m6A on XIST, a result recapitulated with knockdown of METTL3. Finally, the authors showed that the reader protein YTHDC1 is critical for m6A recognition on Xist and downstream transcription silencing. Altogether, these data support the model that RBM15/RBM15B recruit the METTL3-WTAP complex to XIST for targeted methylation. In addition, this work positions m6A as a dynamic regulator of physiological gene silencing and that the methylation state of ncRNA may be critical to their function.",

        "text": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as death of cardiomyocytes secondary to a prolonged ischemic event, which typically results from an inadequate supply of oxygen to meet the heart\u2019s metabolic demands [76,77]. MI is a major manifestation of cardiovascular diseases and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Aberrant expression of several miRs has been shown to be associated with MI. For example, miR-1, miR-133, miR-208a/b, miR-499, and miR-328 have all been shown to modulate the cardiac damage following an acute MI [78,79,80]. Multiple lncRNAs such as aHIF, ANRIL, KCNQ1OT1, MIAT, and MALAT1 also have been found to be dysregulated in MI [81]. Although many studies have shown that a number of miRs and lncRNAs are involved with MI, a few studies have identified the specific interactions between miRs and lncRNAs that occur in association with MI. Wang et al. revealed that miR-188-3p can suppress autophagy and MI damage through its target on ATG7, an enzyme known to be a key player in the autophagy pathway [82]. Furthermore, the lncRNA autophagy-promoting factor (APF) has been shown to modulate autophagic cell death and MI through its interaction with miR-188-3p (Table 2 and Figure 2). APF directly inhibits miR-188-3p and leads to increased ATG7 expression, which results in increased autophagy and infarct size [65]. Wang et al. also demonstrated the involvement of miR-103/107 and lncRNA H19 in myocardial necrosis through Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) [66]. Previous studies have indicated that receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK) 1 and 3 activation can regulate specific types of necrosis. FADD has been shown as a negative modulator of RIPK 1 and 3 [83,84,85]. H19 acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-103/107, which results in miR-103/107 downregulation (Table 2 and Figure 2). Decreased levels of miR-103/107 prevent the downregulation of FADD, thus allowing FADD to inhibit H2O2-induced necrotic cell death by its negative regulation on RIPK 1 and 3. Researchers have only just begun to learn the importance of the interaction of ncRNAs and its significance during pathogenesis of MI. Further investigation is warranted to expand our knowledge on these ncRNAs in the hope of offering increased protection to individuals suffering from MIs.",

        "text": "In Figure S5, we show the example with available structural information of a protein complex that associates two diseases. This protein complex is formed by the interaction between the transforming growth factor \u00df receptor type-2 (TGFBR2, accession number P37173) and the transforming growth factor \u00df-3 (TGFB3, accession number P10600). The genes that produce TGFBR2 and TGFB3 are associated with diseases in cluster I. TGFBR2 is also associated with diseases in cluster II. This molecular interaction yields semi-direct types of links between colonic/pancreatic neoplasms and i) skin neoplasms, ii) osteoporosis and iii) pulmonary fibrosis. TGFBR2 (TGF-beta type I serine/threonine kinase receptor) is part of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, one of the most commonly altered pathways in cancer33. It binds isoforms of TGF-\u03b2 (TGFB3 among them), which are tumour suppressors in the healthy intestinal epithelium, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis34. A mutation affecting the association between TGFBR2 and TGFB3 would potentially affect the transduction of TGFB3 signal to the cytoplasm, affecting the expression of cell-cycle checkpoint genes. Furthermore, both proteins are associated with multiple types of neoplasms, while TGFB3 has been associated with lung neoplasms, liver cirrhosis, osteoporosis and pulmonary fibrosis35, 36. We observe that TGFBR2 and TGFB3 interact through PFAM domains PF08917 (ectodomain of the transforming growth factor \u00df receptor type-2) and PF00019 (transforming growth factor \u00df-like domain), respectively. The three-dimensional structure of this interaction is known37 and deposited in the PDB38 (PDB code 2PJY). The structural analysis reveals that the substitution I50V in TGFBR2 (i.e. the residue I73V in the UniProt sequence of P37173) affects the interface between both proteins. The analysis of the effect of the mutation on the interaction with ROSETTA39 shows a decrease of binding energy in the mutant form I50V of TGFBR2, with \u0394\u0394G\u2248\u2009+\u20091\u2009kcal/mol (see Table 1), indicating a potential loss of the interaction. Likewise, PCRPi-Webserver40 assigns the highest probability among all interface residues of TGFBR2 to I50, as a critical (i.e. hot spot) residue in the interaction. Furthermore, this mutation has been associated with colorectal cancer41, thus further supporting the significant association we identify between colorectal and lung cancer through functional measures (Table S3). The combined functional and molecular level evidence suggests I50V mutation on TGFBR2 as a potential biomarker for lung cancer.",

We chose CC31, CC40 and CC54 in the extracted 60 canonical components as examples. In CC31, we received 3 miRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-34b and hsa-miR-34c). The numbers of target genes for the 3 miRNAs were 139, 32 and 50, respectively. The top-ranked target gene for the 3 miRNAs was ZAP70. Experimental evidence indicated that tyrosine kinase encoded by this gene plays an essential role in regulation, such as immune response, thymocyte development and cytokine expression of mature T-cells. Meanwhile, the top-predicted disease was sarcoma, which was a highly malignant tissue neoplasm caused by proliferation of mesodermal cells. Records in the latest version of CTD [39], a publicly available database curated information about environmental factors affecting human health, indicated that ZAP70 was one of disease genes for sarcoma. Two miRNAs (hsa-miR-106b and hsa-miR-93) were included in CC40. For hsa-miR-106b, it targeted 47 genes and 34 genes were targeted by hsa-miR-93. The top predicted genes were DAB2 and PTENP1 and the top ranked diseases were Lung Diseases and Ovary Syndrome. In CTD, we discovered that both genes were related to Lung Diseases. Even though, no information was available in CTD about the roles of the two genes in Ovary Syndrome. Studies showed that DAB2 was expressed in normal ovarian epithelial cells and the down-regulation of DAB2 may lead to ovarian carcinogenesis [40]. In CC54, 5 genes (ANAPC1, RPIA, IGF2BP2, CYP2J2 and LRIG1) and 1 disease (Cataract) were extracted as a correlated set. Cataracts often affect old people, causing blurry vision. It was reported that more than half of Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery by the age of 80 (https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/). Therefore, detecting the genetic causes of cataracts is of great importance. The retrieval of information from CTD suggested that all the 5 target genes were genetic factors of the disease Cataract.",

The microarray data of lncRNAs and mRNAs with differential expression in BC tissues were analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. LncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (lncRNA HOTAIR) expression in BC was assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was confirmed using MTT and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Cell mobility and invasiveness were testified by transwell assay. RNA pull-down and dual luciferase assay were used for analysis of the correlation between lncRNA HOTAIR and miR-20a-5p, as well as relationship of miR-20a-5p with high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). Tumor xenograft study was applied to confirm the correlation of lncRNA HOTAIR/miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis on BC development in vivo. The expression levels of the lncRNA HOTAIR were upregulated in BC tissues and cells. Knockdown lncRNA HOTAIR inhibited cell propagation and metastasis and facilitated cell apoptosis. MiR-20a-5p was a target of lncRNA HOTAIR and had a negative correlation with lncRNA HOTAIR. MiR-20a-5p overexpression in BC suppressed cell growth, mobility, and invasiveness and facilitated apoptosis. HMGA2 was a target of miR-20a-5p, which significantly induced carcinogenesis of BC. BC cells progression was mediated by lncRNA HOTAIR via affecting miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 in vivo. LncRNA HOTAIR affected cell growth, metastasis, and apoptosis via the miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis in breast cancer.",

        "text": "Members of the miR-34 family are induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and are known to inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and therefore presumably suppress the early phases of metastasis. Here, we determined that exposure of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to the cytokine IL-6 activates the oncogenic STAT3 transcription factor, which directly represses the MIR34A gene via a conserved STAT3-binding site in the first intron. Repression of MIR34A was required for IL-6-induced EMT and invasion. Furthermore, we identified the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which mediates IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation, as a conserved, direct miR-34a target. The resulting IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop was present in primary colorectal tumors as well as CRC, breast, and prostate cancer cell lines and associated with a mesenchymal phenotype. An active IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a loop was necessary for EMT, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cell lines and was associated with nodal and distant metastasis in CRC patient samples. p53 activation in CRC cells interfered with IL-6-induced invasion and migration via miR-34a-dependent downregulation of IL6R expression. In Mir34a-deficient mice, colitis-associated intestinal tumors displayed upregulation of p-STAT3, IL-6R, and SNAIL and progressed to invasive carcinomas, which was not observed in WT animals. Collectively, our data indicate that p53-dependent expression of miR-34a suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting a IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop.",

        "text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, contributing significantly to a diverse range of cellular processes, including apoptosis. One such lncRNA is NEAT1, which is elevated in several types of cancer and aid in cancer growth. However, recent studies have also demonstrated that the knockdown of NEAT1 can inhibit cancer cells proliferation, movement, and infiltration while enhancing apoptosis. This article explores the function of lncRNA NEAT1 knockdown in regulating apoptosis across multiple cancer types. We explore the existing understanding of NEAT1's involvement in the progression of malignant conditions, including its structure and functions. Additionally, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which NEAT1 modulates the cell cycle, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, movement, and infiltration in diverse cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and retinoblastoma. Furthermore, we review the recent studies investigating the therapeutic potential of NEAT1 knockdown in cancer treatment. Targeting the lncRNA NEAT1 presents a promising therapeutic approach for treating cancer. It has shown the ability to suppress cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis in various cancer types.",

        "text": "Accumulating studies have shown that miRNAs play a critical role in many important biological processes, including cell proliferation9, development10, differentiation11 and apoptosis12, metabolism13,14, aging13,14, signal transduction15, viral infection11 and so on. In particular, it was observed that miRNAs with similar sequences or secondary structures tend to play roles in similar biological processes16. Furthermore, the dysregulations of the miRNAs have been confirmed to be associated with the development and progression of various complex human diseases17,18,19. Recent plenty of studies have found that miRNAs are associated with various cancers or cancer related processes20. For example, mir-335 and mir-31 are considered to be the robust inhibitors in breast cancer21,22,23. Another example is mir-21, whose upregulation could promote hormone-dependent and hormone-independent growth in prostate cancer24,25. What\u2019s more, mir-101 was found to be involved in human breast cancer by targeting Stathmin1 and mir-185 was found to be involved in human breast carcinogenesis by targeting Vegfa26,27. The levels of mir-27b and miR-134 were found significantly lower in lung tumors than normal tissue, which suggested that they are associated with lung cancer28. Identifying disease-related miRNAs could benefit disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention29,30,31. However, using experimental methods to identify the associations between miRNAs and diseases is demanding and costly. As more and more biological datasets are available, it would be an effective way to develop computational methods to uncover the potential associations between miRNAs and diseases32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39.",

        "text": "Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) that form the inner wall of blood vessels can be injured by high glucose-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Although the role of long noncoding RNA in regulating cell fate has received widespread attention, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can both regulate autophagy and apoptosis need to be discovered. In this study, we identified that a small chemical molecule, 3-benzyl-5-([2-nitrophenoxy] methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO), synthesized by us, could inhibit VEC autophagy and apoptosis induced by a high concentration of glucose. To find new lncRNAs that regulate autophagy and apoptosis in VECs, we performed lncRNA microarray analysis. We found and verified an upregulated lncRNA named CA7-4 that was induced by a high concentration of glucose could be downregulated by 3BDO most obviously among all of the detected lncRNAs. Meanwhile, we investigated the mechanism of CA7-4 in regulating VEC autophagy and apoptosis. The results showed that CA7-4 facilitated endothelial autophagy and apoptosis as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by decoying MIR877-3P and MIR5680. Further study elucidated that MIR877-3P could trigger the decrease of CTNNBIP1 (catenin beta interacting protein 1) by combining with its 3' UTR and then upregulating CTNNB1 (catenin beta 1); MIR5680 inhibited the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by targeting and decreasing DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4). Therefore, CA7-4, MIR877-3P and MIR5680 represent new signal pathways that regulate VEC autophagy and apoptosis under the high-glucose condition.Abbreviations: 3BDO: 3-benzyl-5-([2-nitrophenoxy] methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one; 3' UTR: 3' untranslated region; AGO2: argonaute RISC catalytic component 2; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase/protein kinase AMP-activated; BAX/BCL2L4: BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator; BCL2: BCL2 apoptosis regulator; CASP3: caspase 3; ceRNA: competing endogenous RNA; CTNNB1: catenin beta 1; CTNNBIP1/ICAT: catenin beta interacting protein 1; DPP4: dipeptidyl peptidase 4; FGF2/FGF-2: fibroblast growth factor 2; HG: high concentration glucose (30 mM glucose); lncRNA: long noncoding RNA; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; miRNA: microRNA; MIR4778-3P: microRNA 4778-3p; MIR561-3P: microRNA 561-3p; MIR5680: microRNA 5680; MIR877-3P: microRNA 877-3p; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; Mut: mutant; NC: negative control; NG: normal concentration glucose (5.5 mM glucose); PARP1: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; qPCR: quantitative real-time PCR; RNA-FISH: RNA-\ufb02uorescence in situ hybridization; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TGFB2-OT1: TGFB2 overlapping transcript 1; TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; VECs: vascular endothelial cells; WT: wild type.",

        "text": "LncRNAs, defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, are not translated into proteins [9]. LncRNAs, aberrantly expressed in various types of cancer cells, play a vital role in several common hallmarks of cancer [10]. In general, lncRNAs exert regulatory functions at different levels of gene expression, including chromatin modification, transcription, and post-transcription. As for chromatin modification, lncRNAs interact with chromatin remodeling complexes to induce heterochromatin formation in specific genomic loci, resulting in reduced gene expression. Moreover, lncRNAs modulate transcription by interacting with RNA-binding proteins and co-activators of transcriptional factors, or by regulating the major promoters of their target genes. Mechanically, lncRNAs exert their regulatory effects through communication with DNA, mRNAs, ncRNAs, and proteins, serving as different functional molecules, such as signals, decoys, scaffolds, and guides in various cancer-related cellular processes [11,12]. Previous studies reported that lncRNAs work mainly as signaling molecules in many important Colorectal cancer (CRC)-related pathways, or as scaffold guides to decoy CRC-specific protein partners, as well as a cis- and trans- regulator element for gene expression. For example, the oncogenic lncRNAs mapped to chromosome 8q.24, such as CACS11, CCAT family, and PVT1, promote CRC progression by interacting with proteins to stimulate myc or other Wnt target gene expression at the posttranslational level [13]. Furthermore, lncRNAs (Figure 1) are frequently involved in different stages of CRC from precancerous polyps to distant metastasis, which could be considered potent diagnostic biomarkers [14,15]. In recent years, increasing studies have demonstrated the existence of lncRNA-mediated competitive RNA crosstalk in CRC progression (Table 1).",

        "text": "The initial findings that RBPs bind to TL regions of miRNAs and influence their processing, such as the examples described above (Table 1), prompted a global search for additional factors that control miRNA processing. Several strategies have been developed with the aim of identifying precursor miRNAs (both pri- and pre-miRNAs) whose biogenesis is affected by the binding of RBPs. These include the identification of additional miRNA precursors bound by cognate RBPs (Towbin et al. 2013), and identification of novel RBPs for a particular precursor miRNA sequence/s (Treiber et al. 2017, 2018a; Choudhury and Michlewski 2018). A biochemical method involving an RNA pull-down combined with SILAC mass spectrometry (RP-SMS) led to the identification of trans-acting factors that regulate the processing of miR-7, miR-9, and let-7 (Choudhury and Michlewski 2018). In the case of miR-9, which is specifically expressed in the brain, this approach led to the identification of LIN28A, which binds to pri-mir-9 in differentiating cells and induces the degradation of its precursor through a uridylation-independent mechanism (Nowak et al. 2014).",

        "text": "In contrast to the simple positive expression module of most TE snoRNAs, the majority of UE snoRNAs and few ovary- and breast-enriched snoRNAs use a complex regulatory module that separates the expression of the snoRNA from its HG (Fig. 6, second expression from the left). In most cases, this separation of expression is achieved through DI promoters that use different transcription initiation sites (either canonical YR-initiation or non-canonical YC-initiation) depending on the need of the different tissues. The snoRNA is expressed regardless of the initiation site, but the host transcript accumulates only when the YR-initiation is used, which protects the transcript from degradation by NMD. In this way, the cell may regulate the expression of the HG without interfering with the uniformity of snoRNA abundance, which likely responds to the need for snoRNAs with a housekeeping function such as most UE snoRNAs. As expected, the non- and anticorrelated HGs using DI sites are not enriched in housekeeping genes like ribosomal protein genes. Instead, they mainly include genes that regulate RNA maturation and processing such as genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, it seems that in most cases the separation of HG and snoRNA functions is needed to liberate the snoRNA from tissue and condition-dependent control of the HG. Interestingly, in few cases like SNORD63 and SNORD50A, the promoter duality may even allow the snoRNA to develop non-canonical functions such as regulating pre-mRNA stability and polyadenylation [46, 47]. Further studies are however needed to characterize the biological relevance of a lack of positive correlation between a snoRNA and its HG and to decipher what distinguishes anticorrelated from non-correlated snoRNAs. Collectively, the data presented here and summarized in Fig. 6 indicate that the human snoRNome meets the demands of both uniform and tissue-enriched abundance through a broad spectrum of regulatory mechanisms that define the relationship between the snoRNA and its HG expression.",

        "text": "Background & aims: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a carcinogenesis event that promotes metastasis and resistance to therapy by unclear mechanisms. Expression of the colon cancer-associated transcript 2 gene (CCAT2), which encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), associates with CIN, but little is known about how CCAT2 lncRNA regulates this cancer enabling characteristic. Methods: We performed cytogenetic analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116, KM12C/SM, and HT29) overexpressing CCAT2 and colon organoids from C57BL/6N mice with the CCAT2 transgene and without (controls). CRC cells were also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, \u03b3-H2AX, and senescence assays. CCAT2 transgene and control mice were given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium to induce colon tumors. We performed gene expression array and mass spectrometry to detect downstream targets of CCAT2 lncRNA. We characterized interactions between CCAT2 with downstream proteins using MS2 pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analyses. Downstream proteins were overexpressed in CRC cells and analyzed for CIN. Gene expression levels were measured in CRC and non-tumor tissues from 5 cohorts, comprising more than 900 patients. Results: High expression of CCAT2 induced CIN in CRC cell lines and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Mice that expressed the CCAT2 transgene developed chromosome abnormalities, and colon organoids derived from crypt cells of these mice had a higher percentage of chromosome abnormalities compared with organoids from control mice. The transgenic mice given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium developed more and larger colon polyps than control mice given these agents. Microarray analysis and mass spectrometry indicated that expression of CCAT2 increased expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. CCAT2 lncRNA interacted directly with and stabilized BOP1 ribosomal biogenesis factor (BOP1). CCAT2 also increased expression of MYC, which activated expression of BOP1. Overexpression of BOP1 in CRC cell lines resulted in chromosomal missegregation errors, and increased colony formation, and invasiveness, whereas BOP1 knockdown reduced viability. BOP1 promoted CIN by increasing the active form of aurora kinase B, which regulates chromosomal segregation. BOP1 was overexpressed in polyp tissues from CCAT2 transgenic mice compared with healthy tissue. CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA or protein were all increased in microsatellite stable tumors (characterized by CIN), but not in tumors with microsatellite instability compared with nontumor tissues. Increased levels of CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA correlated with each other and with shorter survival times of patients. Conclusions: We found that overexpression of CCAT2 in colon cells promotes CIN and carcinogenesis by stabilizing and inducing expression of BOP1 an activator of aurora kinase B. Strategies to target this pathway might be developed for treatment of patients with microsatellite stable colorectal tumors. Keywords: Aneuploidy; MSS; Noncoding RNA; Tumorigenesis.",

        "text": "Background: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by a dysfunction of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) proliferation, migration and premature apoptosis during embryonic development, resulting in aganglionic colon. Our aim is to explore the role of miR-144 with its target gene Transcription Factor AP 4 (TFAP4) in nerve cells in HSCR. Methods: The relative expression levels of miR-144 in HSCR colon samples were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Western blot assays were conducted to investigate the TFAP4 protein expressing level. The interaction of miR-144 and TFAP4 was predicted with bioinformatics analysis and examined with luciferase reporter assays. Overexpression or knockdown of miR-144 and TFAP4 in 293T and SH-SY5Y cell lines was applied. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected by CCK-8 assays, Transwell migration and invasion assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometric analysis. Results: Downregulation of miR-144 and upregulation of TFAP4 were shown in HSCR. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-144 reduced luciferase activity in 293T and SH-SY5Y transfected with TFAP4-WT-3UTR luciferase reporter and confirmed TFAP4 was the downstream target gene of miR-144. Data showed that miR-144 promoted the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of 293T and SH-SY5Y, while TFAP4 blocked the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. TFAP4 overexpression reversed the miR-144-mediated cell proliferation, migration and invasion of 293T and SH-SY5Y. Conclusions: Downregulation of miR-144 blocked the cell proliferation and migration of nerve cells via targeting TFAP4 and contributed to the pathogenesis of HSCR. This provides an innovative and candidate target for treatment of HSCR.",

        "text": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in many biological processes by affecting gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. lncRNAs are dysregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and this dysregulation is closely related to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and prognosis. Although many lncRNAs have been identified in CRC, the relation between ZNF667 antisense RNA 1 (head to head; ZNF667-AS1, accession: NR_036521.1) and CRC remains unclear. In this study, a total of 2,218 differentially expressed genes and 428 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified between tumor and pericarcinous tissues. They were mainly enriched in cancer pathways, chemokine signaling, phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B signaling pathway, and others. Key lncRNAs, including ZNF667-AS1, and their corresponding genes, such as ankyrin 2 (ANK2), were downregulated in CRC tumor tissues. In addition, downregulated ZNF667-AS1 (NR_036521.1) expression is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. Overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 (NR_036521.1) inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of VOLO cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and ANK2 were significantly down- and upregulated in the overexpressed ZNF667-AS1 VOLO cells compared to those in the negative-control group. Knockdown of ANK2 or overexpression of JAK2 significantly counteracted the inhibitory effects of overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 on LOVO cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, it is indicated in our research that ZNF667-AS1 interaction with ANK2/JAK2 maybe important in CRC progression. Overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, which may be related with the high ANK2 and low JAK2 levels.",

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which APOE \u03f54 renders AD risk are unclear. In this report, we present genetic evidence that an apoE receptor, LRP, may be associated with the expression of late-onset AD. Using a biallelic genetic marker in exon 3 LRP, late-onset AD cases markedly differed from the control subjects in the distribution of LRP genotypes, and this difference was highly accentuated among AD cases with positive family history of senile dementia. Furthermore, the numbers of neuritic plaques were significantly altered as a consequence of different LRP genotypes in postmortem AD cases. Taken together, our results implicate the pathophysiology of LRP in the expression of late-onset AD.",

Recent studies have shown extensive ac4C modifications in human and yeast mRNAs. ac4C helps to correctly read codons during translation and improves translation efficiency and the stability of mRNA. At present, the research of ac4C involves a variety of detection methods. The formation of ac4C is closely related to N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) and its helpers, such as putative tRNA acetyltransferase (TAN1) for tRNA ac4C and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) for rRNA ac4C. Also, ac4C is associated with the development, progression, and prognosis of a variety of human diseases. Here, we summarize the history of ac4C research and the detection technologies of ac4C. We then summarized the role and mechanism of ac4C in gene-expression regulation and demonstrated the relevance of ac4C to a variety of human diseases, especially cancer. Finally, we list the future challenges of the ac4C research and demonstrate a research strategy for the interactions among several abundant modified nucleosides on mRNA.",

Diagnosis and clinical supervision remain a challenge due to varying phenotypic presentation and insufficient characterization of the syndrome. Here we combine health data-driven epidemiology and molecular level systems biology to improve the understanding of KS and the molecular interplay influencing its comorbidities. In total, 78 overrepresented KS comorbidities were identified using in- and out-patient registry data from the entire Danish population covering 6.8 million individuals. The comorbidities extracted included both clinically well-known (e.g. infertility and osteoporosis) and still less established KS comorbidities (e.g. pituitary gland hypofunction and dental caries). Several systems biology approaches were applied to identify key molecular players underlying KS comorbidities: Identification of co-expressed modules as well as central hubs and gene dosage perturbed protein complexes in a KS comorbidity network build from known disease proteins and their protein\u2013protein interactions. The systems biology approaches together pointed to novel aspects of KS disease phenotypes including perturbed Jak-STAT pathway, dysregulated genes important for disturbed immune system (IL4), energy balance (POMC and LEP) and erythropoietin signalling in KS. We present an extended epidemiological study that links KS comorbidities to the molecular level and identify potential causal players in the disease biology underlying the identified comorbidities.",

        "text": "Although more than 98% of the human genome is non-coding1, nearly all of the drugs on the market target one of about 700 disease-related proteins. The historical reluctance to invest in non-coding RNA stems partly from requirements for drug targets to adopt a single stable conformation2. Most RNAs can adopt several conformations of similar stabilities. RNA structures also remain challenging to determine3. Nonetheless, an increasing number of diseases are now being attributed to non-coding RNA4 and the ability to target them would vastly expand the chemical space for drug development. Here we devise a screening strategy and identify small molecules that bind the non-coding RNA prototype Xist5. The X1 compound has drug-like properties and binds specifically the RepA motif6 of Xist in vitro and in vivo. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis reveals that RepA can adopt multiple conformations but favours one structure in solution. X1 binding reduces the conformational space of RepA, displaces cognate interacting protein factors (PRC2 and SPEN), suppresses histone H3K27 trimethylation, and blocks initiation of X-chromosome inactivation. X1 inhibits cell differentiation and growth in a female-specific manner. Thus, RNA can be systematically targeted by drug-like compounds that disrupt RNA structure and epigenetic function.",

In this study, we explored the role and mechanism of Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) NEAT1 in trophoblasts apoptosis. In the placenta tissues of PE patients and H2O2-treated human trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo, the expressions of LncRNA NEAT1, p53, and estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR\u03b1) were increased whereas miR-18a-5p expression was decreased. ESR\u03b1 expression was up-regulated by LncRNA NEAT1 overexpression and down-regulated by miR-18a-5p overexpression in HTR-8/SVneo cells. LncRNA NEAT1 could release ESR\u03b1 expression through sponging miR-18a-5p and the transcription of LncRNA NEAT1 was promoted by p53. miR-18a-5p overexpression suppressed H2O2-induced cell apoptosis in HTR-8/SVneo cells, while the inhibitory effect of miR-18a-5p overexpression on cell apoptosis was abrogated by LncRNA NEAT1 overexpression. In summary, LncRNA NEAT1 transcription was induced by p53 under oxidative stress condition, the high expression of LncRNA NEAT1 subsequently increased ESR\u03b1 expression by sponging miR-18a-5p, thus inducing trophoblasts apoptosis.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs containing approximately 18-22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression by interfering with transcription or inhibiting translation. Recent studies have reported that miRNAs could provide information about the molecular pathogenesis of several types of tumors. This study aimed to examine the expression levels of miRNA-885 and -451 and to determine their potential roles as biomarkers in meningioma. Materials and methods: In total, 29 patients with meningioma (9 males and 20 females) were included in this study. The expression levels of miRNA were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to analyze the predictive potential of miRNAs. Results: Our results indicated a significant increase in miRNA-451 expression levels (p=0.003); however, there was no significant change in miRNA-885 expression levels (p=0.139) in patients with meningioma compared with the control group. Moreover, miRNA-885 and miRNA-451 expression levels did not differ significantly based on the histopathological grade of meningioma. Conclusion: miRNA-451 may be a novel potential marker for the diagnosis and prognosis, and a target for meningioma treatment.",

        "text": "Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a family of rheumatic disorders that could be divided into axial (axSpA) and peripheral (perSpA) sub-forms depending on the disease clinical presentation. The chronic inflammation is believed to be driven by innate immune cells such as monocytes, rather than self-reactive cells of adaptive immune system. The aim of the study was to investigate the micro-RNA (miRNA) profiles in monocyte subpopulations (classical, intermediate and non-classical subpopulations) acquired from SpA patients or healthy individuals in search for prospective disease specific and/or disease subtype differentiating miRNA markers. Several SpA-specific and axSpA/perSpA differentiating miRNAs have been identified that appear to be characteristic for specific monocyte subpopulation. For classical monocytes, upregulation of miR-567 and miR-943 was found to be SpA-specific, whereas downregulation of miR-1262 could serve as axSpA-differentiating, and the expression pattern of miR-23a, miR-34c, mi-591 and miR-630 as perSpA-differentiating markers. For intermediate monocytes, expression levels of miR-103, miR-125b, miR-140, miR-374, miR-376c and miR-1249 could be used to distinguish SpA patients from healthy donors, whereas the expression pattern of miR-155 was identified as characteristic for perSpA. For non-classical monocytes, differential expression of miR-195 was recognized as general SpA indicator, while upregulation of miR-454 and miR-487b could serve as axSpA-differentiating, and miR-1291 as perSpA-differentiating markers. Our data indicate for the first time that in different SpA subtypes, monocyte subpopulations bear disease-specific miRNA signatures that could be relevant for SpA diagnosis/differentiation process and may help to understand SpA etiopathology in the context of already known functions of monocyte subpopulations.",

        "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem worldwide. The roles of microRNAs in the regulation of HBV expression are being increasingly recognized. In this study, we found that overexpression of miR-370 suppressed HBV gene expression and replication in Huh7 cells, whereas antisense knockdown of endogenous miR-370 enhanced HBV gene expression and replication in Huh7 cells and HepG2.2.15 cells. Further, we identified the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) as a new host target of miR-370. Overexpression and knockdown studies showed that NFIA stimulated HBV gene expression and replication. Importantly, overexpression of NFIA counteracted the effect of miR-370 on HBV gene expression and replication. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-370 suppressed HBV replication and gene expression by repressing HBV Enhancer I activity, and one of the NFIA binding site in the Enhancer I element was responsible for the repressive effect of miR-370 on HBV Enhancer I activity. Altogether, our results demonstrated that miR-370 suppressed HBV gene expression and replication through repressing NFIA expression, which stimulates HBV replication via direct regulation on HBV Enhancer I activities. Our findings may provide a new antiviral strategy for HBV infection.",

        "text": "Rationale: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation is the most abundant chemical posttranscriptional modification in mRNA and is involved in the regulation of a number of biological processes. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) has recently been reported as having the capacity to recognize m6A sites in mRNA and plays a role in regulating mRNA metabolization. However, it is unclear which genes IGF2BP1 targets to identify m6A sites and what are their respective functions in endometrial cancer (EC). Methods: Quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to measure IGF2BP1 expression in EC cell lines and tissues. Xenograft experiments were performed to examine the in vivo role of IGF2BP1 in EC cell growth. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation sequencing, methylated RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing were also conducted to identify potential IGF2BP1 targets involved in EC regulation. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify IGF2BP1-interacting proteins. Results: IGF2BP1 expression increased in EC, and high expression of this protein correlated with poor prognosis. IGF2BP1 overexpression/knockdown can promote (and inhibit) cell proliferation and regulate the tumor cell cycle and cancer progression, both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, IGF2BP1 can recognize m6A sites in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Paternally Expressed Gene 10 (PEG10) mRNA and recruits polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1) to enhance PEG10 mRNA stability, which consequently promotes PEG10 protein expression. Additionally, it would appear that a large number of PEG10 proteins bind p16 and p18 gene promoter sequences, thereby repressing expression and accelerating the cell cycle. Conclusion: This investigation found that IGF2BP1 has a crucial role in the m6A-dependent regulatory mechanism for endometrial cancer. This study provides new insights into our understanding of disease progression and provides another potential route for understanding biological functions.",

Firstly, we investigated the characteristics of miRNAs and diseases in the network based on the degree distribution. We found that the degree distribution for most miRNAs was low, and only a few miRNAs played a global regulatory role in the regulation of a large number of disorders (Additional file 1: Figure S2A). For example, hsa-miR-590-5p exhibited the largest degree and was recently found to be dysregulated in many diseases [39\u201341]. The top 10 miRNAs that exhibited the largest degree of distribution are shown in Figure 2A. In the other hand, we observed that most of the diseases were associated with only a small number of miRNAs (Additional file 1: Figure S2B). Moreover, some single, complex human diseases were related to numerous miRNAs. Huntington's disease exhibited the largest degree, which is associated with numerous miRNAs such as hsa-miR-128 [42], hsa-miR-9* [43], and hsa-miR-330 [44]. The top 10 diseases exhibiting the largest degree of distribution are shown in Figure 2B.",

We performed a germline copy number variation (CNV)-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) in populations of Chinese ancestry to search for germline CNVs that increase risk of HCC. Methods: We conducted a CNV-based GWAS of 1583 HCC cases (persons with chronic HBV infection and HCC) and 1540 controls (persons with chronic HBV infection without HCC) in Chinese populations. Identified candidates were expressed in L-02, HepG2, or TP53-/- or wild-type HCT116 cells, and knocked down with short hairpin RNAs in HepG2, Bel-7402, and SMMC-7721 cells; proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis were measured. Formation of xenograft tumors from cell lines was monitored in nude mice. Subcellular localization of ribosome proteins and levels or activity of p53 were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Levels of small nucleolar RNA H/ACA box 18-like 5 (SNORA18L5) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: We identified a low-frequency duplication at chromosome 15q13.3 strongly associated with risk of HBV-related HCC (overall P = 3.17 \u00d7 10-8; odds ratio, 12.02). Copy numbers of the 15q13.3 duplication correlated with the expression of SNORA18L5 in liver tissues. Overexpression of SNORA18L5 increased HCC cell proliferation and growth of xenograft tumors in mice; knockdown reduced HCC proliferation and tumor growth. SNORA18L5 overexpression in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells inhibited p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Overexpression of SNORA18L5 led to hyperactive ribosome biogenesis, increasing levels of mature 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs and causing the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11 to stay in the nucleolus, which kept them from binding to MDM2. This resulted in increased MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Levels of SNORA18L5 were increased in HCC tissues compared with nontumor liver tissues and associated with shorter survival times of patients. Conclusions: In a CNV-based GWAS, we associated duplication at 15q13.3 with increased risk of HBV-related HCC. We found SNORA18L5 at this location to promote HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. SNORA18L5 increases ribosome biogenesis, facilitates ribosomal RNA maturation, and alters localization of RPL5 and RPL11, allowing for increased MDM2-mediated proteolysis of p53 and cell cycle arrest.",

        "text": "Translational regulation provides another mechanism for lncRNA-mediated gene expression. In this regard, lincRNA-p21 serves as an inhibitor of JunB and \u03b2-catenin translation in a HuR dependent manner (Yoon et al 2012). The mRNA UTRs often serve a regulatory element for translational control. For instance, lncRNA antisense (Uchl1) promotes UCHL1 protein synthesis by enhancing the interaction of the 5\u2032 overlapping sense protein-coding mRNA with active polysomes (Carrieri et al 2012). Several reports indicate that p53 translation can be regulated through its 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 UTR (Halaby and Yang 2007) (Grover et al 2008). In particular, we show that Linc-RoR is able to suppress p53 translation by interacting with the phosphorylated hnRNP I, and blocking its interaction with p53 5\u2032-UTR (Zhang et al 2013a). Of interest, different lncRNAs may share the same target. A well-known target is Ezh2 which can be targeted by multiple lncRNAs. For instance, HOTAIR interacts with Ezh2 to suppress a number of genes such as JAM2 whereas it induces genes such as SNAIL (Gupta et al 2010). Several other lncRNAs can also target Ezh2. For example, suppression of MALAT1 increases E-cadherin expression, whereas it reduces \u03b2-catenin expression in an Ezh2 dependent manner (Hirata et al 2015). Furthermore, ANCR regulates the stability of Ezh2, leading to suppression of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer (Li et al 2017). These findings further support the complexity of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation. However, it remains to be determined as to whether these lncRNAs simultaneously or selectively target Ezh2 in different cellular contents, and Ezh2 is essential to regulation of gene expression by these lncRNAs. Thus, systematic characterization of this regulatory network may provide a better answer to this question.",

        "text": "Among the electroneutral Na+-dependent chloride transporters, NKCC1 had until now evaded identification as a protein causing human diseases. The closely related SLC12A transporters, NKCC2 and NCC have been identified some 25 years ago as responsible for Bartter and Gitelman syndromes: two renal-dependent salt wasting disorders. Absence of disease was most surprising since the NKCC1 knockout mouse was shown in 1999 to be viable, albeit with a wide range of deleterious phenotypes. Here we summarize the work of the past 5 years that introduced us to clinical cases involving NKCC1. The most striking cases are of 3 children with inherited mutations, who have complete absence of NKCC1 expression. These cases establish that lack of NKCC1 causes deafness; CFTR-like secretory defects with mucus accumulation in lung and intestine; severe xerostomia, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, and severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Another intriguing case is of a patient with a dominant deleterious SLC12A2 allele. This de novo mutation introduced a premature stop codon leading to a truncated protein. This mutant transporter seems to exert dominant-negative effect on wild-type transporter only in epithelial cells. The patient who suffers from lung, bladder, intestine, pancreas, and multiple endocrine abnormalities has, however, normal hearing and cognition. Finally, new reports substantiate the haploinsufficiency prediction of the SLC12A2 gene. Cases with single allele mutations in SLC12A2 have been linked to hearing loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "text": "Objective: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic (COVID-19), with huge health and economic losses. The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Materials and methods: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. Results: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 \u03bcg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 \u03bcg (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. Conclusions: The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.",

        "text": "Cholesterol contributes to the structural basis of biological membranes and functions as a signaling molecule, whose dysregulation has been associated with various human diseases. Here, we report that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG6 increases progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by modulating cholesterol-induced mTORC1 activation. Mechanistically, cholesterol binds ER-anchored FAF2 protein to promote the formation of a SNHG6-FAF2-mTOR complex. As a putative cholesterol effector, SNHG6 enhances cholesterol-dependent mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activation via enhancing FAF2-mTOR interaction at ER-lysosome contacts, thereby coordinating mTORC1 kinase cascade activation with cellular cholesterol biosynthesis in a self-amplified cycle to accelerate cholesterol-driven NAFLD-HCC development. Notably, loss of SNHG6 inhibits mTORC1 signaling and impairs growth of patient-derived xenograft liver cancer tumors, identifyifng SNHG6 as a potential target for liver cancer treatment. Together, our findings illustrate the crucial role of organelle-associated lncRNA in organelle communication, nutrient sensing, and kinase cascades.",

        "text": "Obesity, in which the functional importance of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) remains elusive, correlates with risk for many cancer types. Here, we identify that the serum copies of adipocyte-expressed SNORD46 correlate with body mass index (BMI), and serum SNORD46 antagonizes interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling. Mechanically, SNORD46 binds IL-15 via G11, and G11A (a mutation that significantly enhances binding affinity) knockin drives obesity in mice. Functionally, SNORD46 blocks IL-15-induced, FER kinase-dependent phosphorylation of platelet glycoprotein 4 (CD36) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) in adipocytes, leading to inhibited lipolysis and browning. In natural killer (NK) cells, SNORD46 suppresses the IL-15-dependent autophagy, leading to reduced viability of obese NK. SNORD46 power inhibitors exhibit anti-obesity effects, concurring with improved viability of obese NK and anti-tumor immunity of CAR-NK cell therapy. Hence, our findings demonstrate the functional importance of snoRNAs in obesity and the utility of snoRNA power inhibitors for antagonizing obesity-associated immune resistance.",

        "text": "Gynecological cancers (GCs) are currently among the major threats to female health. Moreover, there are different histologic subtypes of these cancers, which are defined as \u2018rare\u2019 due to an annual incidence of <6 per 100,000 women. The majority of these tend to be associated with a poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the normal development of organisms as well as in tumorigenesis. LncRNAs can be classified into tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, depending on their function within the cellular context and the signaling pathways in which they are involved. These regulatory RNAs are potential therapeutic targets for cancer due to their tissue and tumor specificity. However, there still needs to be a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of numerous biological functions in humans, both in normal health and disease. The lncRNA Mortal Obligate RNA Transcript (MORT; alias ZNF667-AS1) has been identified as a tumor-related lncRNA. ZNF667-AS1 gene, located in the human chromosome region 19q13.43, has been shown to be silenced by DNA hypermethylation in several cancers. In this review, we report on the biological functions of ZNF667-AS1 from recent studies and describe the regulatory functions of ZNF667-AS1 in human disease, including cancer. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging insights into the potential role of ZNF667-AS1 as a biomarker and novel therapeutic target in cancer, including GCs (ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers).",

        "text": "Several studies have investigated the direct binding between miRNAs as a mode of miRNA:miRNA interaction. The first of these determined that miR-424 and miR-503 both directly regulate miR-9 via recognition sites in its pri-miRNA form. Several important facets of miRNA:miRNA interactions were uncovered in a communication by Zisoulis et al. (2012). This study demonstrated that the mature Caenorhabditis elegans miRNA let-7 could bind to and regulate pri-let-7 to promote its production, forming a positive feedback loop. The miR-122 recognition site within the pri-miR-21 transcript lies within the region recognised by Drosha, and binding of miR-122 to pri-miR-21 blocks Drosha-mediated cleavage and processing, ultimately reducing the amount of mature miR-21 within the cell (Wang et al., 2018a). This mechanism has significant implications for cell growth and proliferation, as miR-21 is a known regulator of the tumour suppressor programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) (Lu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2018a). This was most evident in a hepatoma mouse model, in which the addition of miR-122 and mutant pri-miR-21 increased tumour growth compared to wild-type pri-miR-21. Another manner of direct miRNA:miRNA interactions is through the recognition of complementary sequences within two mature miRNAs. For example, miR-107 binds to a complementary sequence within the tumour-suppressing miRNA let-7, resulting in the suppression of the mature let-7. Several direct miRNA:miRNA interactions have been implicated in disease development. The mature let-7 miRNA is controlled by miR-107. Because let-7 is a tumour suppressor, its downregulation and suppression by miR-107 leads to an increase in the abundance of its target oncogenes, contributing to downstream tumorigenesis (Chen et al., 2011). Similarly, owing to the role of miR-484 in cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Wang et al., 2012), the direct interaction between miR-361 and miR-484 has implications on cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, the downregulation of pri-miR-9 by miR-503 and miR-484 promotes cellular lineage commitment (Forrest et al., 2010). If this interaction is disrupted, miR-9 is upregulated, leading to an undifferentiated state typical of cancer cells. Another oncogenic miRNA, miR-21, is overexpressed in most solid malignancies. In non-cancerous liver cells, miR-21 is under miR-122-mediated inhibition, which increases the expression of the miR-21 target gene PDCD4, controlling cell proliferation. However, if miR-122 regulation is lost, miR-21 expression increases, leading to a decrease in PDCD4 levels and thus contributing to a cancer phenotype (Lu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2018a). miR-21 upregulation affects cell proliferation and size, and allows for the continued growth and survival of cancer cells. Therefore, the miRNA:miRNA interaction between miR-122 and pri-miR-21 is vital in controlling cellular homeostasis, the cell cycle and the prevention of oncogenic changes.",

        "text": "Ferroptosis is primarily caused by intracellular iron catalytic activity and lipid peroxidation. The potential interplay between ferroptosis and apoptosis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the expression of a nuclear long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LINC00618, is reduced in human leukemia and strongly increased by vincristine (VCR) treatment. Furthermore, LINC00618 promotes apoptosis by increasing the levels of BCL2-Associated X (BAX) and cleavage of caspase-3. LINC00618 also accelerates ferroptosis by increasing the levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron, two surrogate markers of ferroptosis, and decreasing the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Interestingly, VCR-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis are promoted by LINC00618, and LINC00618 accelerates ferroptosis in a manner dependent upon apoptosis. LINC00618 attenuates the expression of lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH), and LSH enhances the transcription of SLC7A11 after the recruitment to the promoter regions of SLC7A11, further inhibiting ferroptosis. Knowledge of these mechanisms demonstrates that lncRNAs related to ferroptosis and apoptosis are critical to leukemogenesis and chemotherapy.",

        "text": "The cytokines represent a broad group of proteins, many of which have a number of isoforms [94]. For example, the splice variants of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1 and FGF-2), transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 and IGF-2), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1 and CSF-4), interleukin family (IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and platelet-derived, placenta and vascular endothelial growth factors (PDGF, PGF and VEGF). The cytokines and their splice variants are involved in a broad number of biological processes, in variety of diseases and they have been targeted as therapeutic agents [95-96]. A single gene gives a rise to several distinct isoforms of VEGF which differ in their expression patterns and properties [97]. The targeted decrease in VEGF level and/or the blocking of VEGF receptors resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways have been demonstrated to be therapeutic anti-angiogenesis approach for partial treatment of various cancer types. Although VEGF splice variants have mostly pro-angiogenic features, several novel splice variants of VEGF with anti-angiogenic properties were identified recently and were tested for more efficient anti-angiogenesis therapy [98-99]. Another study was dedicated to IGF-I and to better understanding the function mechanism of three splice variants (IGF-IEa, IGF-IEb and IGF-IEc) [100]. IGF-I produced in skeletal muscle is known to play the role in skeletal muscle development, growth and repair. IGF-IEa, IGF-IEb and IGF-IEc are up-regulated (in different time courses) in the muscles of elderly people and they cause high resistance exercise. Although some of the IL-1 family cytokines are known to be important parts of development and inflammation regulation (e.g. IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), the function of IL-37 was not well explained yet. Recently, IL-37 was studied as a new anti-inflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 family together with its five different splice variants [101].",

        "text": "Small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) is a long non-coding RNA that has physiological roles in epithelial and muscle satellite cells. This lncRNA has been reported to be over-expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines. Its silencing has attenuated tumor growth in animal models of cancers. SNHG8 can be served as a molecular sponge for some miRNAs to regulate their target genes. miR-634/ZBTB20, miR-335-5p/PYGO2, miR588/ATG7, miR-152/c-MET, miR-1270/BACH1, miR-491/PDGFRA, miR-512-5p/TRIM28, miR-149-5p/PPM1F, miR-542-3p/CCND1/CDK6, miR-656-3p/SERBP1, miR-656-3p/SATB1, miR-1270/S100A11 and miR-384/HOXB7 are examples of molecular axes being regulated by SNHG8 in the context of cancer. Moreover, it can affect pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, chronic cerebral ischemia, acute gouty arthritis, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction through modulation of a number of molecular axes such as SNHG8/miR-384/Hoxa13/FAM3A and miR-335/RASA1 as well as NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The current review aims at summarization of the role of SNHG8 in diverse human disorders.",

        "text": "Background: Cerebrovascular disease often coexists with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While both diseases share common risk factors, their interrelationship remains unclear. Increasing the understanding of how cerebrovascular changes interact with AD is essential to develop therapeutic strategies and refine biomarkers for early diagnosis. Objective: We investigate the prevalence and risk factors for the comorbidity of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and cerebrovascular disease in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing, and further examine their cross-sectional association. Methods: A total of 598 participants (422 cognitively normal, 89 with mild cognitive impairment, 87 with AD) underwent positron emission tomography and structural magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of A\u03b2 deposition and cerebrovascular disease. Individuals were categorized based on the comorbidity status of A\u03b2 and cerebrovascular disease (V) as A\u03b2-V-, A\u03b2-V+, A\u03b2+V-, or A\u03b2+V+. Results: Advancing age was associated with greater likelihood of cerebrovascular disease, high A\u03b2 load and their comorbidity. Apolipoprotein E \u025b4 carriage was only associated with A\u03b2 positivity. Greater total and regional WMH burden were observed in participants with AD. However, no association were observed between A\u03b2 and WMH measures after stratification by clinical classification, suggesting that the observed association between AD and cerebrovascular disease was driven by the common risk factor of age. Conclusion: Our observations demonstrate common comorbid condition of A\u03b2 and cerebrovascular disease in later life. While our study did not demonstrate a convincing cross-sectional association between A\u03b2 and WMH burden, future longitudinal studies are required to further confirm this.",

        "text": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are secretory membranous elements used by cells to transport proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs). While their existence has been known for many years, only recently has research begun to identify their function in intercellular communication and gene regulation. Importantly, cells have the ability to selectively sort miRNA into EVs for secretion to nearby or distant targets. These mechanisms broadly include RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA2B1 and Argonaute-2, but also membranous proteins involved in EV biogenesis such as Caveolin-1 and Neural Sphingomyelinase 2. Moreover, certain disease states have also identified dysregulated EV-miRNA content, shedding light on the potential role of selective sorting in pathogenesis. These pathologies include chronic lung disease, immune response, neuroinflammation, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and heart disease. In this review, we will overview the mechanisms whereby cells selectively sort miRNA into EVs and also outline disease states where EV-miRNAs become dysregulated.",

        "text": "Establishing the causal associations between coeliac disease and mental health is challenging, as ongoing symptoms may obviously have a negative effect on mood. In any case, many psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, seem to be overrepresented at least in untreated patients. 91 , 92 The biological mechanisms behind this association remains to be ascertained although disturbances in the gut\u2013brain axis and white matter tract changes have been hypothesised. 89 , 93 , 94 However, psychiatric comorbidities have been reported to be increased also among treated coeliac disease patients. 92 , 95 , 96 The underlying pathogenesis and role of gluten\u2010free diet on psychological symptoms and quality of life are currently unclear due to the paucity of the long\u2010term follow\u2010up studies. 97 , 98 Altogether, patients' mental health and the presence of psychiatric symptoms require attention when coeliac disease is diagnosed. Low\u2010threshold psychiatric consultation should be provided at the latest when the symptoms persist despite successful treatment or there is a suspicion of concomitant psychiatric disease. An additional issue to be considered is that a gluten\u2010free diet may be difficult to maintain and socially restrictive and therefore give rise, for example, to increased anxiety and emotional distress. 99 In fact, Shah et al. reported coeliac disease patients to have as high a treatment burden as those dependent on dialysis due to end\u2010stage renal disease. 100 Patients with a psychiatric comorbidity may find the strict dietary restriction particularly burdensome 101 and the often\u2010observed incomplete clinical response may further impair motivation for treatment. 102 , 103 , 104 Conversely, even well\u2010responding patients may be at risk for increased anxiety if their approach towards the diet is hypervigilant.",

        "text": "Background: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process linked to metastasis and drug resistance with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) playing pivotal roles. We previously showed that miR-100 and miR-125b, embedded within the third intron of the ncRNA host gene MIR100HG, confer resistance to cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether the MIR100HG transcript itself has a role in cetuximab resistance or EMT is unknown. Methods: The correlation between MIR100HG and EMT was analyzed by curating public CRC data repositories. The biological roles of MIR100HG in EMT, metastasis and cetuximab resistance in CRC were determined both in vitro and in vivo. The expression patterns of MIR100HG, hnRNPA2B1 and TCF7L2 in CRC specimens from patients who progressed on cetuximab and patients with metastatic disease were analyzed by RNAscope and immunohistochemical staining. Results: The expression of MIR100HG was strongly correlated with EMT markers and acted as a positive regulator of EMT. MIR100HG sustained cetuximab resistance and facilitated invasion and metastasis in CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. hnRNPA2B1 was identified as a binding partner of MIR100HG. Mechanistically, MIR100HG maintained mRNA stability of TCF7L2, a major transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, by interacting with hnRNPA2B1. hnRNPA2B1 recognized the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) site of TCF7L2 mRNA in the presence of MIR100HG. TCF7L2, in turn, activated MIR100HG transcription, forming a feed forward regulatory loop. The MIR100HG/hnRNPA2B1/TCF7L2 axis was augmented in specimens from CRC patients who either developed local or distant metastasis or had disease progression that was associated with cetuximab resistance. Conclusions: MIR100HG and hnRNPA2B1 interact to control the transcriptional activity of Wnt signaling in CRC via regulation of TCF7L2 mRNA stability. Our findings identified MIR100HG as a potent EMT inducer in CRC that may contribute to cetuximab resistance and metastasis by activation of a MIR100HG/hnRNPA2B1/TCF7L2 feedback loop.

        "text": "Background: It is known that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PTCSC3 is involved in thyroid cancer and glioma, but its function in osteoporosis is unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of lncRNA PTCSC3 in osteoporosis. Methods: A total of 80 patients with osteoporosis (4 clinical stages) and four corresponding groups of healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma PTCSC3 levels in the 80 osteoporosis patients and 80 healthy volunteers were measured using RT-qPCR. The diagnostic potential of plasma PTCSC3 for osteoporosis was evaluated by ROC curve analysis with healthy volunteers as the true negative cases and corresponding osteoporosis patients as the true positive cases. Results: PTCSC3 was upregulated in osteoporosis patients compared with healthy controls. PTCSC3 levels increased with osteoporosis stages increasing, but not with healthy controls aging. PTCSC3 overexpression separated each stage of osteoporosis from corresponding controls. PTCSC3 overexpression promoted while PTCSC3 silencing inhibited osteoblast apoptosis. However, PTCSC3 overexpression and silencing showed no significant effect on osteoclast apoptosis. LncRNA PTCSC3 was upregulated in osteoporosis and negatively regulated osteoblast apoptosis. Conclusion: LncRNA PTCSC3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis.",

        "text": "Under normal conditions, the vasculature functions to maintain vascular homeostasis through regulation of factors including vasomotor action, hemostatic balance, and inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by loss of vasodilatory ability alongside an inflammation and thrombosis-promoting state, is an important event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and predicts future CV events [26, 27]. Serum levels of cell adhesion molecules and other biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction have been reported to be increased in SLE patients relative to healthy controls and associated with markers of SLE disease activity [28, 29]. Endothelial dysfunction may be detected by the measurement of arterial flow-mediated dilation, which has been shown to be predictive for future CV events in various patient populations [30]. Many studies have described that patients with SLE without clinically diagnosed CVD, exhibit decreased endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation in medium vessel arteries compared to healthy controls, suggesting that SLE patients develop endothelial dysfunction prior to the onset of CV events [31\u201333]. Additionally, in patients with SLE, the homeostatic balance between endothelial cell death and repair appears to be disrupted, with SLE patients maintaining increased levels of circulating apoptotic endothelial cells compared to both healthy controls and controls with CVD but not SLE [34]. Work demonstrating depletion and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells associated with increased serum levels of type I interferons (IFNs) in patients with SLE [35] and in mouse models of lupus [36\u201338] further suggests a role for SLE-specific immune dysregulation in producing this imbalance in increased endothelial damage and decreased vascular repair/angiogenesis. Arterial stiffness, and associated properties of reflected pulse waves in the artery, may drive increases in systolic and pulse pressure, increasing risk of CV complications [39]. Further, increased arterial stiffness is predictive of future CV morbidity and mortality in the general population and in various disease states [40\u201342]. In patients with SLE, arterial stiffness is increased relative to controls [33, 43, 44]. Additionally, arterial stiffness has been shown to progress along a similar trajectory to atherosclerotic plaque development within the same artery in SLE, and this progression has a more severe trajectory in the aorta relative to the carotid arteries [45]. Thus, detection of increasing arterial stiffness may indicate progressively worsening CVD and call for directed therapies to address CV risk. SLE patients who report exercising regularly have lower central arterial stiffness than SLE patients who maintain a more sedentary profile [46] and, within SLE, an inverse relationship appears to exist between arterial stiffness (as measured by pulse wave velocity) and cardiorespiratory fitness [47]. However, while SLE patients who underwent a 12-week aerobic exercise treatment exhibited significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness, they did not see significant improvements in measures of arterial stiffness when compared to SLE patients who did not receive this intervention [48]. Given this, there is a need for further studies of the impact of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions on markers of vascular dysfunction and CVD in SLE.",

        "text": "Neuropathological diagnostic criteria of neurodegenerative disorders are based on the presence of specific inclusions in a specific area of brain tissue that correlate with clinical manifestations. Concomitant neurodegenerative disorders correspond to a combination of two (or more) different fully developed diseases in the same patient. Concomitant neurodegenerative pathology represents the presence of definite neurodegeneration and deposits of pathological proteins specific for another disease, which is not, however, fully developed. Very frequent overlaps include Alzheimer's disease and alpha-synuclein inclusions. Nevertheless, careful neuropathological investigations reveal an increasing frequency of different co-pathologies in examined brains. In Alzheimer's disease, protein TDP-43 may co-aggregate, but it is not clear whether this is atypical isolated Alzheimer's disease or overlap of Alzheimer's disease with early frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Comorbidities of Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies are relatively rare. A combination of vascular pathology with primary neurodegeneration (mostly Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies) is historically called mixed dementia. Overlap of different neuropathologically confirmed neurodegenerations could lead to atypical and unusual clinical presentations and may be responsible for faster disease progression. Several CSF biomarkers have been evaluated for their utility in diagnostic processes in different neurodegenerative dementias; however, evidence regarding their role in neurodegenerative overlaps is still limited.",

The top hits for a search by disease of 'Alzheimer\u2019s disease' included hsa-miR-9, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR34a, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-146a, and hsa-miR-155, again all of which are well-documented in the literature [52]. As a last example, the top hits for a search by disease of 'Diabetes mellitus' included hsa-miR-577, hsa-miR-37a, hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-181a, hsa-miR-17, and hsa-miR-24, all of which are reported in the literature. Such searches usually also return miRNAs whose links with the query would not be apparent nor readily ascertained from the literature. Search results for such miRNAs lacking documented disease connections might offer hypotheses for future investigations.",

        "text": "The incidence and death rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) is very high, which brings great need to understand the early molecular events of CRC. These studies demonstrate that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in the occurrence and development of human cancer. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) was recently identified as a cancer-related lncRNA. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the function and mechanism of SNHG15 in CRC. The expression of SNHG15 was detected by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in CRC tissues and matched noncancerous tissues (NCTs). CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometric analysis, and nude mouse xenograft mode were used to examine the tumor-promoting function of SNHG15 in vitro and in vivo. The binding relationship between SNHG15, miR-338-3p and the target genes of miR-338-3p were screened and identified by databases, qRT-PCR, dual luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Our results showed that SNHG15 was up-regulated in CRC tissues compared with paired NCTs (P < 0.0001). High level of SNHG15 expression predicted poor prognosis of CRC (P = 0.0051). SNHG15 overexpression could promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis. Animal experiments showed that up-regulation of SNHG15 promoted tumor growth in vivo. The results of mechanism experiments showed that SNHG15 could bind to miR-338-3p and block its inhibition on the expression and activity of FOS or RAB14. In conclusion SNHG15 promotes cell proliferation through SNHG15/miR-338-3p/FOS-RAB14 axis in CRC.

Cancer cells frequently depend on chromatin regulatory activities to maintain a malignant phenotype. It has been shown that leukemia cells require the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex containing the SMARCA4 protein as the catalytic subunit for their survival and aberrant self-renewal potential (43). The relatedness of the two diseases is further supported by a high comorbidity (relative risk (RR) = 2.1) and the clinical finding that intravascular large cell lymphoma affect and obstruct the small vessels of the heart (44). Other disease pairs that lack shared genes but are found in the same neighborhood of the interactome include glioma and gout, glioma and myocardial infarction, and myeloproliferative disorders and proteinuria, each pair having high comorbidity (RR = 2.43, 6.3 and 2.0, respectively).",

The mRNA expression of miR-29a in HCC were identified by qRT-PCR. miR-29a mimic and inhibitor were employed. The alteration of biological behavior was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), clone formation, transwell and wound-healing assay. SIRT1 was verified to be a target gene which directly regulated by miR-29a. Luciferase reporter assay and co-IP were employed to evaluate the direct binding of miR-29a and SIRT1. Animal model was used to evaluate its function on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The relationship between miR-29a/SIRT1 and prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed. SIRT1 overexpression accompanied by low expression of miR-29a were detected in HCC which was negatively correlated, and associated with overall survival, vascular invasion and TNM stage. Up-regulation of miR-29a suppressed cell growth and motility. Deprivation of miR-29a expression led to opposite effect. The direct binding of miR-29a to SIRT1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and co-IP. miR-29a repressed SIRT1, DKK2 and \u03b2-catenin, but their expression was obviously elevated by miR-29a inhibitor. Animal model suggested miR-29a could reduce the expression of SIRT1, thereby inhibiting HCC growth and metastasis by inactivating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Low expression of miR-29a and high expression of SIRT1 predicted shorter survival time in HCC patients. miR-29a had the function of tumor suppressor which directly inhibited oncogenic SIRT1. The loss of miR-29a led to up-regulation of SIRT1, aggravate malignant transformation and poor prognosis of HCC.",

        "text": "One of the main proteins in m6A, METTL3, is known to regulate apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2 in different types of cancer [135,136]. Knockdown of METTL3 induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells by affecting apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, PARP, Caspase 3) and inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT leading to the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway [137]. METTL3 siRNA-mediated downregulation decreases mRNA and protein levels of Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3 (NOTCH3) [138], Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) [139] and Hairy and Enhancer of Split-1 (HES1) [140]. Knockdown of METTL3 inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines. These data show that m6A methylation influences the NOTCH pathway, which is a potential target for glioblastoma treatment [141]. It is known that the NOTCH pathway influences many vital cell processes including apoptosis, so activation of this pathway by m6A-mediated stabilization of NOTCH3, DLL3 and HES1 mRNA, and increased expression of corresponding proteins, leads to the inhibition of apoptosis. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-seq (MeRIP-seq) and integrated transcriptome analyses showed that decreasing the expression of METTL3 downregulated m6A modification levels of serine and arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSF), which promoted the YTHDC1-dependent non-sense mediated decay of SRSF transcripts and decreased SRSF protein expression, and that is why apoptosis was activated [142].",

        "text": "At the molecular level, cardiac remodeling is accompanied by a gene expression switch from the adult \u03b1\u2013MHC isoform to the fetal \u03b2-MHC. MiR-208a, which is encoded in the intron of the \u03b1-MHC gene, has been shown to be involved in this process, inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis and increasing \u03b2-MHC expression. De-etion of miR-208a protects the heart from pathological remodeling under stress conditions. Thyroid-hormone-receptor-associated protein 1 (THRAP1) is considered a target gene for miR-208a.3,34 MiR-21 promotes myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis by repressing the Sprouty2 transcription factor, which controls the pro-fibrotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathway. Specific antagomiR-mediated inhibition of miR-21 blocks this cascade and results in a reduction in both hypertrophy and fibrosis.13 However, genetic deletion of miR-21 does not alter the pathological cardiac response to pressure overload.34 This discrepancy indicates that miR-21 plays a complex role in the pathophysiology of heart diseases, which requires further investigation. Another possibility may be the existence of a compensatory mechanism revealed under a permanent miR-21 knock-down.",

        "text": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complex, multifactorial life-threatening disease that involves vascular endothelial cell (VEC) dysfunction. However, the exact pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of VTE are not completely clear. The aim of this study was to identify the core genes and pathways in VECs that are involved in the development and progression of unprovoked VTE (uVTE). The microarray dataset GSE118259 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and 341 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated genes were identified in the VTE patients relative to the healthy controls, including CREB1, HIF1\u03b1, CBL, ILK, ESM1 and the ribosomal protein family genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-target gene network were constructed with these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and visualized using Cytoscape software 3.6.1. Eighty-nine miRNAs were predicted as the targeting miRNAs of the DEGs, and 197 TFs were predicted as regulators of these miRNAs. In addition, 237 node genes and 4 modules were identified in the PPI network. The significantly enriched pathways included metabolic, cell adhesion, cell proliferation and cellular response to growth factor stimulus pathways. CREB1 was a differentially expressed TF in the TF-miRNA-target gene network, which regulated six miRNA-target gene pairs. The up-regulation of ESM1, HIF1\u03b1 and CREB1 was confirmed at the mRNA and protein level in the plasma of uVTE patients. Taken together, ESM1, HIF1\u03b1 and the CREB1-miRNA-target genes axis play potential mechanistic roles in uVTE development.",

        "text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute the largest and most diverse class of non-coding RNAs. They localize to the nucleus, cytoplasm, or both compartments, and regulate gene expression through various mechanisms at multiple levels. LncRNAs tend to evolve faster and present higher tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression than protein-coding genes. Initially considered byproducts of erroneous transcription without biological function, lncRNAs are now recognized for their involvement in numerous biological processes, such as immune response, apoptosis, pluripotency, reprogramming, and differentiation. In this study, we focused on Heart Brake lncRNA 1 (HBL1), a lncRNA recently reported to modulate the process of pluripotent stem cell differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. We employed RT-qPCR and high-resolution RNA FISH to monitor the expression and localization of HBL1 during the differentiation progression. Our findings indicate a significant increase in HBL1 expression during mesodermal and cardiac mesodermal stages, preceding an anticipated decrease in differentiated cells. We detected the RNA in discrete foci in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In the latter compartment, we observed colocalization of HBL1 with Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), which likely results from an interaction between the RNA and the protein, as the two were found to be coimmunoprecipitated in RNP-IP experiments. Finally, we provide evidence that HBL1, initially reported as an independent lncRNA gene, is part of the LINC00458 (also known as lncRNA-ES3 or ES3) gene, forming the last exon of some LINC00458 splice isoforms.",
