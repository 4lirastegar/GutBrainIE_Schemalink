    "AnatomicalLocationHumanRelationship": "The schema is titled 'GutBrainIE CLEF 2025 Challenge' and described as follows: This template is meant for extracting structured information from biomedical abstracts related to the gut microbiota and its connections with Parkinson's disease and mental health, aiming to foster the development of Information Extraction (IE) systems that can support experts in understanding the gut-brain interplay.\nGeneral Entity Annotation RULES: - Annotate using full words only. DO NOT select only part of a word or a whole word along\n  with a part of an adjacent word. \n- A 'word' is defined as a portion of text that is delimited by a whitespace on both the\n  left and right. Words connected by symbols such as '-', '_', etc., should be considered\n  as a single word. Examples: \u201cb-sitosteryl\u201d is a single word; \u201cgenus_ruminococcaceae\u201d is\n  a single word; \u201cshort-chain fatty acids\u201d is composed of three words: short-chain, fatty,\n  and acids; \u201coligofructose-treated db/db mice\u201d is composed of three words:\n  oligofructose-treated, db/db, and mice.\n- In some texts, markdown characters such as <i>, <b>, <sub>, etc., are included. We leave out\n  these characters if they are annotating only the words between them. However,\n  if they are annotating those words along with others outside the markdown tags, the markdown\n  characters should be included. Examples: \u201cb-sitosteryl\u201d is a single word;\n  \u201cgenus_ruminococcaceae\u201d is a single word; \u201cshort-chain fatty acids\u201d is composed of three\n  words: short-chain, fatty, and acids; \u201coligofructose-treated db/db mice\u201d is composed\n  of three words: oligofructose-treated, db/db, and mice.\n- In some texts, markdown characters such as <i>, <b>, <sub>, etc., are included. Annotators\n  should leave out these characters if they are annotating only the words between them.\n  However, if they are annotating those words along with others outside the markdown tags,\n  the markdown characters should be included. Examples: \"The presence of <i>Ruminococcacae</i>\n  increases the risk...\"; \"An increase of <i>depressive</i> disorders has been noticed\n  after the COVID pandemic\".\n- DO NOT include punctuation at the beginning or end of the mention. If punctuation is\n  within the mention, it should be retained. \u201c... alteration in short-chain fatty acids \u2026\u201d -->\n  short-chain fatty acids; \u201c... leads to depression, that can cumulate \u2026\u201d --> depression\n- Ensure minimal context is preserved to maintain the correct meaning. For example, DO NOT\n  omit suffixes or qualifiers if doing so changes the meaning or classification of the entity. Examples:\n  \u201cBecker muscular dystrophy gene\u201d should be annotated as a gene entity, not just \u201cBecker muscular\n  dystrophy\u201d which would be a disease; \u201cdGK kinase deficiency\u201d should be annotated as a disease,\n  not just \u201cdGK kinase\u201d which would be a gene.\n- Include all relevant contextual modifiers, such as adjectives, prepositional phrases,\n  and qualifiers, needed to capture the full and precise meaning of the entity mentions. Examples:\n  \u201cWe recruited 54 subjects, including 27 patients with MDD\u201d; \u201cThe alpha diversity\n  indices of MDD patients are \u2026\u201d; \u201cSamples from 20 VVS children and \u2026\u201d; \u201cMale mice fed on diet\n  supplemented with \u2026\u201d; \u201c... were significantly enhanced in EC-12 supplemented mice\u201d.\n- Annotate composite entities as a single entity if they belong to the same category. However,\n  if entities belong to the same category but appear as a sequence, annotate them separately. Examples:\n  \"SMADs 1, 5, and 8\" should be annotated as a gene; breast or ovarian cancer\" should be annotated\n  as a disease; \"b-sitosteryl and stigmasteryl linoleates\" should be annotated as a chemical;\n  In \"Cytochrome P-450 genes (CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1),\" label each of \"Cytochrome P-450 genes,\"\n  \"CYP1A1,\" \"CYP2A6,\" \"CYP2D6,\" and \"CYP2E1\" as separate gene entities.\n- DO NOT annotate overlapping entities. An entity cannot include words that are already part\n  of another entity mention. Although we acknowledge that allowing overlapping annotations of\n  entity mentions would be the best approach to better capture the complexity and nuances of\n  biomedical texts, at the current stage, we do not permit overlapping annotations. This decision\n  has been made to simplify the annotation process and reduce the ambiguity that could arise during\n  manual annotation. In \"anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody\" annotators should label the entire\n  text span as a chemical, while they DO NOT have to annotate \"mouse\" as an animal.\n- A text span can have only one entity label. If an entity could belong to multiple categories,\n  use the context within the sentence to determine the appropriate label. In \"... blockade of\n  interleukin-6 receptor in the periphery \u2026\" \"interleukin-6\" might be labeled as a gene,\n  but since it is followed by the word \"receptor\" we label the entire \"interleukin-6 receptor\"\n  as a neurotransmitter.\n- If an entity mention could be annotated in multiple ways, always annotate the longest version.\n  Examples: \u201cchronic sleep disorder\u201d must be annotated in full, rather than just \u201cchronic\n  sleep disorder\u201d; \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d must be annotated in full, rather than\n  just \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d.  When determining the span to annotate and deciding\n  whether to keep the longest version, use the defined annotation tools to search if the\n  longest version is recognized in a well-established knowledge source. When determining the span\n  to annotate, use the existence of reference acronyms in the literature as an indicator to keep\n  the longest version of the entity mention. Examples: \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d is, in\n  the literature, associated with the acronym MDD; \u201camyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d should be\n  annotated in full, rather than just \u201camyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d or \u201camyotrophic lateral\n  sclerosis\u201d, since the acronym \u201cALS\u201d is defined for the entire condition.\n- DO NOT annotate terms that are identical to the entity labels. For example, the term \u201cdisease\u201d\n  by itself should not be annotated as a disease entity, while the term \u201cParkinson disease\u201d should\n  be annotated as a disease entity.\n- Annotate both the abbreviation and its long form separately, if possible. Example:\n  In \u201cProstaglandin E2 (PGE2)\u201d annotate both \u201cProstaglandin E2\u201d and \u201cPGE2\u201d as separate\n  chemical entities\n- If the boundary of an entity comprises both the full name name and its abbreviation,\n  it should be annotated as a single entity. Example: \"Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK)\n  deficiency\" should be annotated as a single disease entity.\n- DO NOT annotate words that are morphological variations of terms that would be entities. Examples:\n  Do not annotate \"hypertensive\" as a disease, even though it is an adjective form of \"hypertension.\"\n  Do not annotate \"VLCAD deficient\" as a disease, even though it refers to \"VLCAD deficiency.\"\n\nGeneral Relation Annotation RULES: - Annotate relations between entities only if they match the defined set of relations provided for\n  the GutBrainIE dataset. If a relation is not part of the defined set, DO NOT annotate it.\n- The head of a relation does not always precede the tail in the text; it may also come after the tail.\n  Annotators should ensure that the correct entities are linked regardless of their order in the text.\n  Examples: In \u201cDepression has been historically treated through antidepressant medications. Nowadays,\n  probiotics supplementation is being used to\u2026\u201d two change effect relations should be annotated, one\n  from \u201cantidepressant medications\u201d (drug) and \u201cdepression\u201d (disease), and the other from \u201cprobiotics\n  supplementation\u201d (dietary supplement) to \u201cdepression\u201d (disease).\n- Annotate relations that are directly and explicitly mentioned in the text. Example: In \u201cFirmicutes\n  influences predisposition to major depressive disorder\u201d an influences relation between \u201cFirmicutes\u201d\n  (bacteria) and \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d (disease) should be annotated\n- Annotate relations implied by the text, even if the specific term describing the relation is not used.\n  Example: In \u201cFirmicutes impact inflammation in the gut\u201d an influences relation should be annotated\n  between \u201cFirmicutes\u201d (bacteria) and \u201cinflammation\u201d (disease), as it is implied by the verb \u201cimpact\u201d.\n- Annotate relations that can be inferred from the context. Relations inferred by reasoning about the\n  text are valid as long as there is clear contextual evidence in the text and no personal, previous,\n  or external knowledge is used for that inference. Example: In \u201cFirmicutes change the expression of\n  gene ARID1B and, therefore, affect predisposition to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in young patients\u201d\n  it can be inferred that \u201cFirmicutes\u201d (bacteria) is related to \u201cAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)\u201d (disease)\n  since it plays a role in affecting the \u201cgene ARID1B\u201d (gene) related to its predisposition. Therefore, two\n  relations should be annotated In this portion of text: the explicit one change expression between \u201cFirmicutes\u201d\n  (bacteria) and \u201cgene ARID1B\u201d (gene), and the inferred one influence between \u201cFirmicutes\u201d (bacteria) and\n  \u201cAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)\u201d (disease); In \u201cBacteroides fragilis produces gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n  GABA has been found to reduce anxiety in mice.\u201d it can be inferred, although not explicitly stated, that\n  \u201cBacteroides fragilis\u201d (bacteria) has a role in reducing \u201canxiety\u201d (disease) through its production of\n  \u201cgamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\u201d (neurotransmitter). Therefore, an influence relation can be inferred\n  between \"Bacteroides fragilis\" (bacteria) and \"anxiety\" (disease).\n- In binary relations, even if labels are not explicitly assigned, the relationship between two entities\n  must align with a valid relationship defined in the extraction of relations as triplets. Example: Considering\n  the relation is linked to holding between the entity types microbiome and disease, any binary relation annotated\n  between a microbiome and a disease must explicitly or implicitly fit this relationship within the abstract context.\n- Co-occurrence is not required. The entities involved in a relation do not need to co-occur in the same sentence.\n  Relations can be annotated even if the entities are in different parts of the abstract, as long as there is\n  sufficient contextual information to support the relation. Example: In \u201cThe gut microbiome is known to produce\n  short-chain fatty acids. [...] The latter populate the intestinal barrier and play a crucial role in maintaining\n  its integrity.\u201d an inferred produced by relation can be annotated between \u201cshort-chain fatty acids\u201d (metabolite)\n  and \u201cgut microbiome\u201d (microbiome) from the first sentence, and a located in relation between \u201cshort-chain fatty\n  acids\u201d (metabolite) and \u201cintestinal barrier\u201d (anatomical location) can be annotated although they do not co-occur\n  in the same sentence.  \n- Avoid overgeneralization, namely, only annotate relations between specific entity instances if there is explicit,\n  implicit, or inferred evidence of their connection within the abstract. Do not assume that all occurrences of the\n  same entity pair have a relation unless it is explicitly or implicitly described. Example: If one mention of \u201cgut\n  microbiome\u201d says \u201cThe gut microbiome is associated with reduced symptoms of Parkinson's disease\u201d and another simply\n  states \u201cParkinson's disease is prevalent among the elderly\u201d only the former should be used to annotate the relation\n  is linked to.\n- If there is a relation from a long version of an entity to another entity, the same relation should be annotated\n  from the short/acronym version of the entity to the same target entity. Example: In \u201cSelective serotonin reuptake\n  inhibitors (SSRIs) have an important role in the pathogenesis of depression.\u201d two relations change effect should\n  be annotated, one from \u201cSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u201d (drug) to \u201cdepression\u201d (disease), and a second\n  one from \u201cSSRIs\u201d (drug) to \u201cdepression\u201d (disease).\n- Annotators should determine if a relation between two entities holds by only considering the information\n  presented in the abstract. Annotators are not allowed to access the full text of the article nor to use any\n  external sources of information. If the abstract is not clear about the relationship, DO NOT annotate it.\n- If annotators are uncertain whether a relation exists between two entities, they should annotate conservatively.\n  Only annotate when there is sufficient evidence to support a direct, implied, or inferred relationship.. Your task is to extract relationships of predicate 'located in' (and its synonyms) between entities of class 'AnatomicalLocation' and 'Human' that are **explicitly mentioned in the provided text**.  **If a protein is not explicitly written in the text, do not include it in the response, even if it is commonly associated with the entities mentioned.** The extraction should be strictly limited to the words present in the text.The 'located in' relationship is described as follows: \"A relationship where an anatomical location is associated with a human.\"\nFrom the text below, you have to identify and extract relationships of predicate 'located in' among instances: human brain of the class 'AnatomicalLocation' and instances patients of the class 'Human'. Entities involved in 'located in' relationships must belong to these sets.\nExtract and include the following attributes for each relationship:\n.\n"
